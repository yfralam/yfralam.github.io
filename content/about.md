# About

Hi, I'm Yasin, a PhD student at UT Austin. Primarily I work on High Energy Theory, particularly string theory, (algebraic) quantum field theory, holography, and connections to quantum information science. I did my undergrad at Texas A&M after which I was a 研究生 at Osaka U. This website is a platform for me to share my thoughts on life, physics, and other interests of mine.

I hope you get something out of perusing this.

Cheers
