## Introduction
Recently, I have been thinking to myself more and more that I should have a blog or a website to write down my thoughts. Inspired by several blogs, including [Jacques Distler's Blog](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/) and finally given the push by an [old friend](https://vajralakushal.github.io/) (who kindly walked me through the setup), I have decided to start this blog. 

Something about having one's own site appeals to me. While twitter (X?), instagram, and other sites are able to share experiences, none of them quite are quite as conducive to documenting thoughts in detail. Of course one should ask next, what do these "thoughts" entail? They should not be too spontaneous as to be worthless (worthless being defined as knowledge that no one, including me, will ever refer to), nor is this the forum to publish ideas that have spent a considerable time being polished (no need to be GRRM or Rothfuss). What that sweet spot is, I am not yet sure. 

## Purpose
This brings us to what the blog will be used for.

### Life
Since times of antiquity (1990s) blogs have been used to document daily life experiences. While I don't intend for this to be the common use, it is worth mentioning. At the very least, I'd like to use this to document various personal events (less so) and thoughts about the world (more so). I say this, but more frivolous uses will be here as well, maybe rating every coffee shop in Austin?
### Physics
Since even more antiquated times (1989), the internet has been used for physics. Taking inspiration from Jacques, I'd like to dedicate a portion of this blog to my thoughts on concepts from physics, news, and the general life of an academic. At some point I'd like to get Latex running. If the bosonic CFT action $$S = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int d^2z \, \partial X \bar \partial X$$is displayed I have succeeded, if not, it's a WIP.
### Learning
Certainly, it is my job to learn new concepts but by this I mean more that just academic learning. Included in this category I have documenting new life skills, 日本語, and even sports (Has anyone noticed that if you throw a dart into a group of theoretical physicists, there's a good chance it will land on someone that boulders? This seems to be an international phenomenon, not just relegated to the states). Certainly more will be added.

### Random thoughts
Worthless != random, nor frivolous and I think (roughly) well thought out random thoughts can go in here as well. 
### Projects
Maybe I can include progress on my personal projects on here, though I am not yet sure. For physics, maybe some updates on what I am personally working on. My background (back in another lifetime) is in computer science so maybe at some point I can consider picking up the rubber ducky again.

These are what I envision as I start this blog, we'll see what happens in the future.

## TODO
The site still needs some setup and there are certain things I'd like to add. Latex being priority #1 but I'd also like to add a discussion feature. Maybe I can convince Kushal to take interest and be my Prometheus...
