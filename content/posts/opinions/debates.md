## A categorization for debates

In recent times, both personally and in the public discourse, there has been a significant focus on debates regarding current events. Oftentimes, it seems like two parties are talking past each other and one has to wonder, "what is the point of this debate?"

Actually, this is a good question, *what is the point of a debate?*  I think a possible categorization can be made by considering who the outcome of the debate will affect. For this, I think the following three categories will be sufficient:

1) Frivolous debates: Debates whose outcomes will not meaningfully affect anyone.
2) Personal debates: Debates whose outcomes will only affect the parties debating.
3) Societal debates: Debates whose outcomes will affect more than just the parties debating.

Maybe a better question I want to answer is the following: Using this categorization, when is it productive to have certain debates?

What do I mean by *productive*? I mean a debate that will change the actions or affect at least one party or others. 
### Frivolous debates

Frivolous debates are those that will not meaningfully affect anyone. These can be debates of opinion such as "I think this movie is better than this one" or "I think <> is a better artist than <>". Whether these debates are subjective or not is besides the point, the result of the debate will not change how either party behaves.  These debates are not productive, but can be fun to have. 

Matters of opinion are not the only things that belong in this category. Debates that one would expect to be in the other two categories (*Personal* or *Societal*) can land in the *Frivolous* category in certain cases. This occurs when at least one of the parties are just talking past the other and have completely made up their mind beforehand. No matter what party A says or evidence it produces, party B will not acknowledge A's points because B did not come in with the possibility of changing their mind. These debates are not productive, and are also infuriating to have. 

While not an implication, these types of debates usually do not need concrete pieces of evidence (historical, scientific, statistical, etc.) and even if they are presented, they are often not the defining pieces argument. 

In either case, no one will change their behavior from this type of debate and it is not a productive endeavor. I want to emphasize that subjectivity of the "right" answer in no way plays into this categorization. 

### Personal debates

Personal debates are those whose outcomes will affect the parties debating. Many things fall into this category. For instance, maybe a friend debates with me to convince me I need to get more exercise. This affects me personally, but not anyone else in a meaningful way. 

I think most academic discussions fall into this category as well. Two parties want to solve or understand a common problem or concept, and the outcome will only affect the two parties. Maybe in changing how one or both parties choose to approach or explain the issue. Often, one can disagree on several points but concede, "in order to figure this out, we need to do this calculation" or "we need to understand this point",

These debates are productive and worth having because they will affect *someone*; however, they can quickly slip into being *Frivolous*. If party A presents a sufficient amount of evidence that any reasonable person could see that party B is wrong, or even if party B *concedes the point*, party B still has no obligation to act in accordance with what the debate was about. Just because all the evidence points to me having to exercise to stay healthy, I have no obligation to do so. While the discussion is not a productive one, I am perfectly in my right to not act and this is fine. It's just that, in this case, the debate is frivolous.

*Personal* debates can have a broad spectrum of evidence to back them up. While statistics and *reputable* articles are still the gold standard, in certain cases, anecdotal evidence is still appreciated. Maybe party A says the best BBQ is a certain location but party B has been to several other locations and convinces A to go somewhere else which B thinks is the best.  

What may seem to be *Personal* or *Frivolous* debates can often slip into *Societal* debates. This happens for issues in which personal beliefs or tendencies are reflected in policies when that person votes or places an active role in a position that affects other people. The reason to be mindful about this transition is *Societal* debates require stronger evidence than *Personal* (and certainly *Frivolous*) debates. 

If a CEO is convinced anecdotally that 5'6" people work the hardest, that is their right. But if they start selecting only 5'6" employees, the burden of proof is much higher. If you try and convince a friend that scientific investment is useless/necessary, that is a societal debate; they can go on to vote for either of those things. 

### Societal debates

Societal debates are perhaps the scariest as the outcomes affect others. Political debates would fall into a (perhaps large) subclass of *Societal* debates. Of course, as mentioned in the previous section, these debates do not just occur by those in power, they also occur in our everyday lives and affect our everyday lives, even if not apparent. After voting, maybe the current economy as a product of the government forces your company to produce layoffs, or maybe congress cuts the budget of a key program. In a functioning democracy, even inaction as an outcome is an action.

When debating things that could change people's lives, the highest standard of evidence is required. This should be well respected, peer studied articles, statistics, or historical events. Anecdotes should not suffice to make decisions for other people as one's personal experience can be skewed. A rather famous example is that in 2025, roughly half of Americans thought crime in America was worse than in 2024 (see [this Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/697124/crime-seen-less-serious-second-straight-year.aspx)) while the FBI statistics show a 4.5% decrease.

If two parties cannot agree on the facts and statistics, a productive societal debate cannot occur. Partially, this is why I think live debates are usually not productive. These statistics are not things one should memorize, but cite as needed. In the heat of a debate, one can forget such facts or statistics or simply not know them. In bad faith live debates, one can cite a skewed or made up statistic and  both parties just have to take it as given. 

It is often the case that these debates occur not to convince the parties debating, but to convince spectators. This too seems to be poor practice. Just because one forgets evidence or is just a bad debater, does not mean their point is wrong. Just because one is charismatic in a debate does not mean they are right. In an ideal world, the spectators would take just the points of the parties, not their appearance, nor their demeanor, and fact check them or critically think about these points.

Academics, (ex. Political and Economic theorists) rarely argue their points in front of a live audience. There is too much to keep track of and it is not a productive when topics are nuanced and take time to digest. Instead, they spread ideas and respond to each other with papers or in depth discussions that take time. Indeed, time is probably one of the biggest factors in having a productive *Societal* debate.

When the federalists were debating the ratification of the constitution in the late 1780's, their primary tool was the *Federalist Papers*, a series of articles and essays in favor of the constitution. These were published in newspapers and gave both opponents and supporters time to digest and respond to the papers.

In some form, I guess I am advocating that *Societal* debates should be relegated to pen and paper or in long terms discussions where both parties can discuss the evidence and validity of the evidence for their points.

## What do we gain?

What do we gain from the above construction? From the categorization, and the classification of evidence? Well, before committing to a debate, it is productive to consider which type of debate you are getting into. *A priori* you know what type of evidence you need to produce and how seriously you need to take the debate. 

If it is a *Frivolous* debate, (even if pretending to be one of the others), it is not worth taking it seriously. You know it will not be a productive conversation as no one will change their mind. If it is a *Societal* debate, you know to have a productive conversation, you will need time and reputable evidence.

It is an excellent idea to clarify with who you are debating with *what kind* of debate you are having. Maybe not in terms of the above classification, but just ask, "Why are we debating this point?"

To conclude, before you get into an argument, consider its purpose, whether it can be productive, and what evidence you need to justify you point.
