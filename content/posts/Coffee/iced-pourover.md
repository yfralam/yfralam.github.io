Almost everyday, usually in the afternoon, either back at home or in the office, I make an iced pour over. While hot coffee and espresso are both wonderful, I find iced pour overs to be clean and refreshing (which is what I especially want in heat). I also think you get to know the coffee more and discern rather subtle notes when you aren't burning your tongue off.

I do love espresso, but I usually reserve cortados and such to the cafes; I have seen the madness that comes with trying to get a perfect shot of espresso out of a home setup and frankly, that is one hobby I am happy to avoid.

## Gear
Here is a short list of gear I use daily
> - V60 or sometimes the Hario "switch"
> - Scale
> - 1zpresso JX Pro hand grinder
> - Gooseneck Kettle

This is essentially it. What I like about pour overs is how low the barrier to entry it is. The most expensive item here is the hand grinder but all of these things last for years. Additionally, quality hand grinders start much cheaper than quality electric ones. At some point I'd like to upgrade the kettle to a temperature controlled one.
