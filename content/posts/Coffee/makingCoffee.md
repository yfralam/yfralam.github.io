## Unnecessary Intro
Almost everyday, usually in the afternoon, either back at home or in the office, I make an iced pour over. While hot coffee and espresso are both wonderful, I find iced pour overs to be clean and refreshing (which is what I especially want in heat). I also think you get to know the coffee more and discern rather subtle notes when you aren't burning your tongue off.

I do love espresso, but I usually reserve cortados and such to the cafes; I have seen the madness that comes with trying to get a perfect shot of espresso out of a home setup and frankly, that is one hobby I am happy to avoid.

## Gear (v1)

Total: ~$30 + grinder cost
A decent grinder I've found is [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-MSCS-2DTB-Skerton-Ceramic-Grinder/dp/B01LXZACFB/ref=sr_1_13?crid=1T4IPXBDM4Y92&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.sjFX33j1kstfpvIHy14-tKISY4oPvofFGUdBn82e6oYn3UAFzmgVEmT5S7_-qnRk_FDn_ZiVIplB_UWxyOajdUGj2yQbMV5-NMxGRx6lVIYyO9O_7rKQlnficrXnNNOvXjn1xdM4OPQfkM2tTt6UvWx__Xq2dWxXtf-ChcL0Ppck54f6OkweuBgP512_oNpG8c5psMtAgSO4kV2kBYeL8Swh5dDSXkKq7BSLJXrKBOkIWLbolZk0PMKiu4PFdf4_m5wF0aT7hDD0ajhhHgFYzlwyrExr-JkpZM1PHKCQUY4.JTJKMsav_YcX--yzdjIZno1G3Pddl2uJa-S5ei6i1nc&dib_tag=se&keywords=hand+grinder+coffee&qid=1728257310&sprefix=hand+grinder%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-13), though for more info I'd just go to [Hoffman](https://youtu.be/dn9OuRl1F3k?si=MF95JEzQDXn3RH5D).

This is essentially it. What I like about pour overs is how low the barrier to entry it is. The most expensive item here is the hand grinder but all of these things last for years. Additionally, quality hand grinders start much cheaper than quality electric ones. At some point I'd like to upgrade the kettle to a temperature controlled one.

## Recipe (v1)

Generically, I like to brew 15:1 water to coffee ratio. For the off times I drink hot coffee, I just follow [Hoffman](https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM?si=dQnSKw6GQy2IL7K_).  Remember for light roasts, to always get the water as hot as possible before brewing.

I think the Switch is a lot more forgiving of a brewer, but V60 is easier to get into and also better for hot coffee in my opinion.

### V60 Iced Pour Over
A variation of [this](https://youtu.be/PApBycDrPo0?si=X-tsfpIr_5Z2i96f) that I think works better for me.
> 150g ice
> 
> 132g water
> 
> 16g coffee

1) Wet the filter paper in the V60 to preheat it
2) Place the V60 over all the ice
3) Pour the ground coffee in and bloom it with about (30g) of water. Swirl to get all the grounds coated
4) Brew the rest of the way as one would normally

### Hario "Switch"
Similar ratios and also taken from [Hoffman](https://youtu.be/8uGGeV8A-BM?si=iEF5KVnWJMvvZZhq).
> 150g ice
> 
> 132g water
> 
> 17g coffee

1) Wet the filter paper in the V60 to preheat it
2) Place the Switch over all the ice
3) Pour the hot water into the empty vessel first, then pour the ground coffee into the hot water and stir
4) Wait at least 5 minutes
5) Drain the coffee into the ice
