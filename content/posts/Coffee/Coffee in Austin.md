It seems I will be here for a while, so I might as well make a list of all the coffee shops I've been to. This list is incomplete. There are some shops that I need to refresh my memory on before reviewing.
## Criteria and Biases
- I have a preference for light roasts, especially naturally processed coffees.
- I prefer shops with a darker, more wooden aesthetic or clean minimalistic designed with a few statement pieces, location and view is important as well. 
- I go to coffee shops for the coffee and to relax, not to work. I will not give any extra points for good productivity reasons, nor will I take away points for things like slow wifi or no outlets, though I will mention them.
- On the first pass, I will usually ask for a cortado, this gives a good indication of the espresso quality and their milk.
- Subsequently I will ask for a mocha, cappuccino, or another espresso based drink.
- I will very rarely ask for a pour over, generally I like to make these at home.
- A cappuccino is ~6 oz, if you have larger sizes, it is just a latte

 **Scoring**:
 - Will score based off of coffee and the aesthetic of the shop.
	 - 1: Pretty bad taste.
	 - 2: Okay Coffee. Not the best but could be worse.
	 - 3: Average coffee shop. Decent coffee. You went in and got exactly what you expect
	 - 4: A very good coffee shop, would be happy to go here every day
	 - 5: Perfect and has a specific niche. Excellent coffee, excellent aesthetic, excellent service. 

Score are subject to change if I go back.

## SHOPS ##

### [Terrible Love](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JfT7g5obpJTZdWHS9)(4/5)

\+ Excellent coffee
\+ Good texture drinks
\- Outside seating
\- No baked goods

- 5 for Coffee
- 3 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
Absolutely excellent cortado. The notes come through clear as day. The milk has just the right texture to accompany the coffee. They also have very good tea. Besides these two items, they don't sell any baked goods, which I miss.

**Vibe**
It's a coffee cart next to a building and there is no indoor seating. Yet, it still seems to have a nice vibe. There are some tables to the side. When it's not too hot outside, it is a nice place to hang around.
### [Barrett's Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CVWLszgWkxf2Yyek7)(3.5)

\+ Above average coffee
\+ Good roasters with great rotating selection

- 4 for Coffee
- 3 for Aesthetic

**Orders** 
When in Austin and needing a bag of coffee, I will usually choose Barrett's. As a roaster they go above expectations. With the free drink I get, I almost always get a cortado, which depending on the day, could be natural processed or a blend of several different origins.

**Vibe** 
Also a dark wooden Aesthetic, lots of seating and a good mix of people working and discussing. there are loads of coffee equipment lining the walls and you can sometimes see them pulling out bags of coffee to roast in the back. A bit industrial for me, but overall very nice. 
### [Civil Goat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6srnbfPZ9qdvENj47)(2.75/5)

\+ Good Lemon tart
\+ Excellent Aesthetic
\- Okay coffee, mainly drowned out by the milk

- 2 for Coffee
- 3.5 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
The cortado I ordered here was not bad at all, though a bit safe for what I like. The taste and texture of the mild really dominated. Excellent lemon tart though.

**Vibe**
I really like the Aesthetic of Civil goat. It has a nice soft modern finish with a nice view of the street. It was extremely busy when I went which I dislike and it looked as if everyone was concentrating on work,


### [Flat Track Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sCcVwytWfuXVoHBq8)(2.75/5)

\+ Good coffee with decent selection
\- A bit of a commercial/industrial feel

- 4 for Coffee
- 1.5 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
Pretty good coffee, the cortado I ordered was a very nice natural processed Ethiopian. I also got some of their coffee that they roasted which I quite enjoyed.

**Vibe**
The location a bit more south of Austin. The vibes were not bad, they did employ a decent amount of wood but the place felt a bit too industrial for me. There's a large Bike rack at the front and I have been told that is where several group rides start/end from. 

### [Medici](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d9jzyjQ3DYZzP4Jy8) (2.25/5)

\+ Nice aesthetic on 2nd floor with good view of outside street
\+ Decent selection of coffee beans
\- Felt extremely commercial with too much merch being sold

- 2.5 for Coffee
- 2 for Aesthetic

**Orders** 
I initially asked for an ice pour over to which the response was, "the pour over machine is broken" which I did not understand. I asked if he could do a manual pour over on a V60, Kalita, or ChemeX, but while these were available, he clearly did not want to make it, and bemoaned how long it would take. Instead I got their "flash brew", a variation of their cold brew which used fermented, washed Ethiopians. For a "cold brew" it was as good as a cold brew could be. The pain au chocolat was nice.  All in all not bad but not the greatest.


**Vibe** 
At initial glance, the vibe is nice. Plus points for wooden aesthetic with a large 1st and 2nd floor. The upstairs is a nice place to work, though clearly the furniture is a bit old and rickety. The wifi was quite slow, though I will not penalize them for this. The barista clearly knew what he was talking about and pointed out several coffee beans when I asked about them that were interesting to me. There is merch on the first floor which seems very out of place.

### [Lucky Lab Coffee Co.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GZz9Ny9NNYeVeTSNA) (2/5) 
\+ Inside aesthetic is nice
\+ Has pretty good baked goods
\- Dark roast coffee primarily
\- Little inside seating and feels congested

- 2 for Coffee
- 2 for Aesthetic
- Good bakery

**Orders**
I got a cappuccino and was asked the dreaded question, "what size?" I was quite disappointed to hear this and if I were not meeting friends there, would have immediately left. Instead, I asked for the 12 oz. The coffee was a dark roast with too much milk to have any discernable notes.
 
 I recently went back and got a pastry which was rather good. I cannot say anything besides that.
**Vibe** 
The location is not bad and is very close to the UT campus. It seems the base is largely students. The inside is nice with a wooden aesthetic which I enjoy. Unfortunately the only seating inside is at the bar. It seems they also have a kitchen for food. The majority of the seating is outside shared with several other stores. It is nice, but not when it is 104 F outside. I was miserable and quickly left after my friends arrived.

### [Spokesman](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E5iTDi6N3ZUVYCYn9) (1.5/5)

- 2 for Coffee
- 1 for Aesthetic

**Orders** 
The cortado here was not bad, but nothing to write home about. A bit too dark for me and the milk dominated anyways. Their Italian soda really hits the spot though.

**Vibe**
It is right outside a climbing gym so the location is nice to go to before or after. I'm not too much of a fan of their d√©cor and the look is very industrial to me.
