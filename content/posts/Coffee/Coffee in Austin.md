It seems I will be here for a while, so I might as well make a list of all the coffee shops I've been to. This list is incomplete. There are some shops that I need to refresh my memory on before reviewing.
## Criteria and Biases
- I have a preference for light roasts, especially naturally processed coffees.
- I prefer shops with a darker, more wooden aesthetic or clean minimalistic designed with a few statement pieces, location and view is important as well. 
- I go to coffee shops for the coffee and to relax, not to work. I will not give any extra points for good productivity reasons, nor will I take away points for things like slow wifi or no outlets, though I will mention them.
- On the first pass, I will usually ask for a cortado, this gives a good indication of the espresso quality and their milk.
- Subsequently I will ask for a mocha, cappuccino, or another espresso based drink.
- I will very rarely ask for a pour over, generally I like to make these at home.
- A cappuccino is ~6 oz, if you have larger sizes, it is just a latte

 **Scoring**:
 - Will score based off of coffee and the aesthetic of the shop.
	 - 1: Pretty bad taste.
	 - 2: Okay Coffee. Not the best but could be worse.
	 - 3: Average coffee shop. Decent coffee. You went in and got exactly what you expect
	 - 4: A very good coffee shop, would be happy to go here every day
	 - 5: Perfect and has a specific niche. Excellent coffee, excellent aesthetic, excellent service. 

Score are subject to change if I go back.

## SHOPS ##

### [First Light Book Shop](https://g.co/kgs/Kw52nXh) (4.25/5)

> 4 for Coffee
- 4.5 for Aesthetic
- Nice book selection

**Orders**
Generally, places with a very nice aesthetic don't have amazing coffee in my experience. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised when I got an excellent cortado rather late at night. I need to go back and try more things, but my one experience so far has been nothing but good.

**Vibe**
As the name suggests, this place is a coffee shop. They have a good amount of indoor seating among the book shelves and a lot of outdoor seating. The area is in Hyde park, so a bit of a quieter part of North Austin. The detailing and ambiance of the store is great and has a nice laid back vibe. I see some people there studying, some there just to read books. I know they have events some times but I have yet to go to one. It is also nice that they are open until 9 PM.

In all, nothing beats drinking coffee while reading in a corner, or browsing books.

### [Terrible Love](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JfT7g5obpJTZdWHS9)(4/5)

\+ Excellent coffee
\+ Good texture drinks
\- Outside seating
\- ~~No baked goods~~

> 5 for Coffee
- 3 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
Absolutely excellent cortado. The notes come through clear as day. The milk has just the right texture to accompany the coffee. They also have very good tea. Besides these two items, they don't sell any baked goods, which I miss.

**Vibe**
It's a ~~coffee cart~~ next to a building and there is no indoor seating. Yet, it still seems to have a nice vibe. There are some tables to the side. When it's not too hot outside, it is a nice place to hang around.

Update: They have moved into an actual building with a singular window wher you can order.

### [Figure 8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mgL8xxDhPqhDvKwW9)(4/5)

\+ Excellent coffee
\+ Good texture drinks
\+ Excellent light roasts
\- Limited seating

> 5 for Coffee
- 3 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
Another excellent cortado. The one I had was very light but not too acidic to where I wouldn't be surprised if they used natural processed (or at least honey).

**Vibe**
It is at a strip mall so the vibe is alright and they have a big window looking out into the parking lot. The interior furniture is quite industrial but the décor is not bad. The closer you sit to the counter the better imo.

### [Barrett's Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CVWLszgWkxf2Yyek7)(3.5/5)

\+ Above average coffee
\+ Good roasters with great rotating selection
\+ Also has great natural processed coffee

> 4 for Coffee
- 3 for Aesthetic

**Orders** 
When in Austin and needing a bag of coffee, I will usually choose Barrett's. As a roaster they go above expectations. With the free drink I get, I almost always get a cortado, which depending on the day, could be natural processed or a blend of several different origins.

**Vibe** 
Also a dark wooden Aesthetic, lots of seating and a good mix of people working and discussing. there are loads of coffee equipment lining the walls and you can sometimes see them pulling out bags of coffee to roast in the back. A bit industrial for me, but overall very nice. 

### [épicerie]( https://maps.app.goo.gl/UfiXCaQiM6854fH89) (3.5/5) 
\+ Very nice interior and design
\+ Amazing pastries (particularly the Beignets )
\- The most mid coffee I've ever had
\- A restaurant, not just a coffee place

> 3 for Coffee
- 4 for Aesthetic
- Excellent Beignets
**Orders**
For full transparency, this place is a restaurant, though you can go in and order coffee at the counter. The coffee itself is the very definition of average. I got a cortado which was what I think of exactly whenever some one mentions "cortado". 

The pastries are excellent and this is the one place in Austin you can get good Beignets. I would come to this place just for the pastries.
 
**Vibe** 
The location is in a quite part of North Austin. There is a lot of natural light and some outside seating as well. It is a restaurant so you can go and get food if you want. The décor is very nice and the environment is nicely lit and cozy.
### [Civil Goat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6srnbfPZ9qdvENj47)(2.75/5)

\+ Good Lemon tart
\+ Excellent Aesthetic
\- Okay coffee, mainly drowned out by the milk

> 2 for Coffee
- 3.5 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
The cortado I ordered here was not bad at all, though a bit safe for what I like. The taste and texture of the mild really dominated. Excellent lemon tart though.

**Vibe**
I really like the Aesthetic of Civil goat. It has a nice soft modern finish with a nice view of the street. It was extremely busy when I went which I dislike and it looked as if everyone was concentrating on work,


### [Flat Track Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sCcVwytWfuXVoHBq8)(2.75/5)

\+ Good coffee with decent selection
\- A bit of a commercial/industrial feel

> 4 for Coffee
- 1.5 for Aesthetic

**Orders**
Pretty good coffee, the cortado I ordered was a very nice natural processed Ethiopian. I also got some of their coffee that they roasted which I quite enjoyed.

**Vibe**
The location a bit more south of Austin. The vibes were not bad, they did employ a decent amount of wood but the place felt a bit too industrial for me. There's a large Bike rack at the front and I have been told that is where several group rides start/end from. 

### [Medici](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d9jzyjQ3DYZzP4Jy8) (2.25/5)

\+ Nice aesthetic on 2nd floor with good view of outside street
\+ Decent selection of coffee beans
\- Felt extremely commercial with too much merch being sold

> 2.5 for Coffee
- 2 for Aesthetic

**Orders** 
I initially asked for an ice pour over to which the response was, "the pour over machine is broken" which I did not understand. I asked if he could do a manual pour over on a V60, Kalita, or ChemeX, but while these were available, he clearly did not want to make it, and bemoaned how long it would take. Instead I got their "flash brew", a variation of their cold brew which used fermented, washed Ethiopians. For a "cold brew" it was as good as a cold brew could be. The pain au chocolat was nice.  All in all not bad but not the greatest.


**Vibe** 
At initial glance, the vibe is nice. Plus points for wooden aesthetic with a large 1st and 2nd floor. The upstairs is a nice place to work, though clearly the furniture is a bit old and rickety. The wifi was quite slow, though I will not penalize them for this. The barista clearly knew what he was talking about and pointed out several coffee beans when I asked about them that were interesting to me. There is merch on the first floor which seems very out of place.

### [Bennu (Highland)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qc1rg1Grkhe9Rk5HA)(2.25/5)

> 1 for Coffee
- 3.5 for Aesthetic
- Open 24/7

**Orders**
I got a cortado and was immediately revolted by what touched my tongue. It was extremely dark and on top of that, tasted sour, so it seems like the shot was not even pulled correctly. I wanted to get a pastry but there were none available. It *was* midnight so I won't hold it against them.
 
**Vibe** 
The location is right in front of Austin Community College so it is usually filled with students. I went around midnight and brought a ([this](https://yfralam.github.io/posts/nihongo/hontachi/)) book to read and saw several people studying or having group discussions. The décor is nice (and consistent). I might go back if I need some late night caffeine outside of the house, or to grade homeworks/exams next time. 

### [Lucky Lab Coffee Co.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GZz9Ny9NNYeVeTSNA) (2/5) 
\+ Inside aesthetic is nice
\+ Has pretty good baked goods
\- Dark roast coffee primarily
\- Little inside seating and feels congested

> 2 for Coffee
- 2 for Aesthetic
- Good bakery

**Orders**
I got a cappuccino and was asked the dreaded question, "what size?" I was quite disappointed to hear this and if I were not meeting friends there, would have immediately left. Instead, I asked for the 12 oz. The coffee was a dark roast with too much milk to have any discernable notes.
 
 I recently went back and got a pastry which was rather good. I cannot say anything besides that.
**Vibe** 
The location is not bad and is very close to the UT campus. It seems the base is largely students. The inside is nice with a wooden aesthetic which I enjoy. Unfortunately the only seating inside is at the bar. It seems they also have a kitchen for food. The majority of the seating is outside shared with several other stores. It is nice, but not when it is 104 F outside. I was miserable and quickly left after my friends arrived.

### [Flightpath Coffeehouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K3b4AnnnMmzPZzAe7) (1.75)

\+ Inside aesthetic is nice
\+ Has pretty good cake
\+ Lot of seating inside
\- Dark roast coffee primarily
\- Not the best quality coffee

> 1.5 for Coffee
- 2 for Aesthetic
-

**Orders**
I got a cortado which was rough, but the slice of chocolate cake was quite good.
 
**Vibe** 
Similar in vibe to Epoch or Sweet Eugenes which is in College Station. Its a darkly lit venue found in Hyde Park and there is some nice outside seating as well. Not my vibe but I can see other people really liking it.

### [Spokesman](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E5iTDi6N3ZUVYCYn9) (1.5/5)

> 2 for Coffee
- 1 for Aesthetic

**Orders** 
The cortado here was not bad, but nothing to write home about. A bit too dark for me and the milk dominated anyways. Their Italian soda really hits the spot though.

**Vibe**
It is right outside a climbing gym so the location is nice to go to before or after. I'm not too much of a fan of their décor and the look is very industrial to me.



### [Epoch Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hz8ePCziPwzudP757) (?)

> 0.5 for Coffee
- ? for Aesthetic
- Open 24/7
- They have coffee
- Must go late night

**Orders**
I got what was technically a cortado.
 
**Vibe** 
During the day, Epoch is a normal coffee shop, during the night, well... 

I went in knowing that the coffee wouldn't be the best. I also went in knowing late at night, there are some... *interesting* events that happen at night. I was told by a friend that last time she went, late at night, she saw a someone randomly reading Jackson electrodynamics, not because he did physics or something, but just that he enjoyed it. 

When I went, I sat outside with my coffee and watched the crowd. At some point (this was around 1 AM) sat at a table outside, pulled a whole computer setup out, and started playing video games. + points for the cat that came up to me and let me pet it for a while.

Will definitely go back.
