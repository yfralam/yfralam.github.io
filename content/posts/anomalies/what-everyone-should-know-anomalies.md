description = "Anomalies show up in almost every single area of physics, from high energy physics to condensed matter systems and have very observables consequences. I hope to cover some basic things about anomalies as consistency checks of theories. The first part should be accessible to everyone but the second part is aimed at those interested in particles."

## Abstract

Symmetries are a guiding principle in physics. They give us an extreme amount of control of a theory which we can use to make principles. A particular class of symmetries called **gauge symmetries** is especially important. They are used to describe the physics of forces. This included electromagnetism, the strong and weak force, and even gravity.

In certain cases, gauge symmetries can be **anomalous**. That is,
