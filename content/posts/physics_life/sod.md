Recently an external review committee (ERC) has commented on the state of the department and proposed possible solutions, or at least places where the department should look into. They discussed with current graduate students as well as faculty to come to some conclusions. Some of these points I agree with, some I am vehemently against.

## Pay

To get the obvious out of the way, the ERC found the students should be payed more. Compared to other similar institutions, we are underpaid by roughly $5000. This is terrible, even before considering the other institutions we were compared to are located in lower cost of living areas than Austin. 

More fellowships would be more appreciated, but a blanket raise seems to be much more useful. The ERC floated the idea of "starting a revenue-generating professional Master program" to provide more funds. This seems, to my inexperienced eyes, a distasteful thing to do.  I am not sure how much value one gets from a "professional Masters" in physics, nor do I know how much this would contribute positively to our department beyond bringing in funds.

## The Building
The physics building (PMA) is perhaps the most unattractive part of this department. The ERC rightfully identifies this as a major issue. Even ignoring the terrible faÃ§ade, the building itself seems to be outright hostile to the *act of doing* physics. 

The different departments, even those who may work together, are outright segregated onto different floors. Even within those floors, there are not meaningful areas to run into and **spontaneously start discussions**. Ideally, this would be a place that was central and where one must pass by on their way to the office. These spontaneous discussions are often where one can informally toss ideas back and forth in a way that is impossible in a classroom or a scheduled meeting. 

(Indeed, this is how I was introduced to the gravitational algebras in the first place, I went to go make coffee and started up a conversation with a colleague on what he had been working on. Neither he nor I particularly knew about the algebras, but after bouncing ideas off of one another, we agreed it would be worthwhile to look at.)

The solution to this is a new building, one conducive to interactions through plenty of common space and less segregated. From a theorists perspective, the point going into work is to interact with others, else in this day and age, we could just work on scratch paper at home (also the reason why I find coming to campus and then keeping your door closed 90% of the time preposterous).

It would be nice to have a building specifically for the Weinberg institute (hopefully with windows in the grad student offices).

As a band-aid fix, the ERC proposed converting the 4th (ground) floor library to an area for interaction. They specified "other departments have in this age of electronic access to journals and books" so I assume they mean to remove the books from the library. This is a terrible idea.

It's good that there are resources available online, but getting rid of books serves no one. Libraries provide an easy means to access information that may otherwise be inaccessible. Beyond the preference of having a physical copy of a book, to gain access to a book, I don't need anything else. I don't need to have an ipad, laptop, phone, etc. If tomorrow my backpack gets stolen with all my electronics inside, I can still come into work the next day and not be hindered due to the reference books in my office.

Additionally, the building spans 17 floors. I don't expect anyone to take a trip all the way down to the 4th floor to just have a casual conversation. It is not conducive to the *spontaneous* discussions I mentioned above. To me, converting the 4th floor library seems to have almost only downsides. 

I am not sure what a good short term solution would be.

## Courses

The ERC's perspective on courses is one place where I have no complaints. To summarize, 4, not just 2 courses should be allowed to be tested out of. The experimental course, while important, should be more encompassing on what counts as "experimental". Right now, it seems to be mainly hands on work which would disqualify most of the high energy experimentalists. 

The coursework itself seems to have a heavy workload, though in my experience, this depends on the professor. From what I saw of my friends taking statistical mechanics, the load seemed to be unnecessarily dense, though Aaron Zimmerman's course on classical mechanics was a good blend of what should necessarily be covered without going into unessacary tedious calculations. Vadim  Kaplunovsky's courses (which I actually took) were difficult, but there were usually clever ways of solving the problems such that the workload was light if you knew what you were doing. 

Overall, the ERC agreed the structure of the courses, along with how the students are advised to take them, contributed to extending how long it took to get the degree. 

They also noted more advanced courses are needed, which I agree with, though I am saddened that this means less HET courses (we lost string theory II).

## Perception

The ERC notes that compared to similar universities, UT attracts almost half the applicants that they do. Some easy factors to blame are the pay and the building (as mentioned above). The ERC claims the long time till graduation due to course structure is also to blame, though anecdotally, I, nor anyone I knew cared about this metric when applying to grad schools (at least, it was not the 1st to n-1'th concern).

They only mention in one line that the issue may be due to being located in Texas itself. Location-wise, there are not many university's close enough to facilitate continuous interactions. The closest to UT would be Texas A&M, and even that is more than an hour drive away. Even then, there aren't many interactions with TAMU to begin with. Compared to universities on the east or west coast that have universities close enough to each other such that scientists can just pop in and out, UT is at a disadvantage. (As another anecdote, the journey between Osaka University and the Yukawa institute is comparable, and there were monthly extraditions where one HET group would go to the others school to just discuss what they were working on and have dinner. Personally I traveled to Kyoto for daytrips quite often to discuss. It was easy to hop on a train and read a paper, especially for ~$4 USD.)

Of course, politics is another issue. Without going into the details, I do not think it is any secret that due to the political tendencies of the current government, there are good graduate students that refuse to apply. This also affects potential faculty. From talking to postdocs who are looking for tenure track jobs, a non-insignificant number of them refuse to come to Texas for the same reason. 

These are just some quick thoughts on the review, many of which I've expressed in person, but it is nice to have them all in one place. I've missed many other things, but this is good enough for now.

## TLDR:

>- Students are payed ~$5k less than similar universities.
>- The building lacks common spaces, is unattractive, and is not conducive to spontaneous discussions. Converting the 4th floor library is a bad idea for a myriad of reasons.
>- The courses are structured too rigidly.
>- Negative perception (leading to less applicants and pulling less faculty) of UT may be due to the pay, building, and location.
