## End of classes

I have just crowned the list of classes I have taken in my academic career with supersymmetry and I won't be taking any other class. It feels weird to come to the end of this journey, especially when one has been taking college classes for the better part of 5 years, and in school for more than two decades. 

A physics degree consists of playing catch up to modern day physics. We start by learning classical mechanics (1700s) then moving on to electromagnetism (mid 1800s) and then quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics (early 1900s). Quantum field theory takes us to the 1950s and on to around the 1970s. If one takes a string theory class, they learn about topics from the 1980's onward (maybe to 1997 with AdS/CFT).

Thus, it is a nice ending point for classes (for which the community should have widespread agreement on material) when the supersymmetry class ends with the [duality cascade]() (2004). So with this class, we are finally taken into the current millennium.

On the bright side, I will no longer have to worry about exams, homework, or grades. At the end of the day, the classes were starting to get in the way of research, and anything I need to learn I feel comfortable teaching myself at this point.

While I don't plan to take any courses for credit (or any current physics classes), I do still plan on sitting in on interesting math classes relevant to my research. Luckily, UT makes this very easy to do.

## A retrospective on classes

In these 5 years, I've taken a lot of classes, Some of them were very useful, some of them were not (most of the computer science classes). I thought it may be fun to go through and make a table. 

Is this a flex that I have 2 degrees? Yes, because that is the only use for my CS degree now.

This is roughly in chronological order.  When the class name is not enough, there is a description. Classes that are 2 semesters are only listed once and bolded (ex E&M 1 and 2 are listed as just *E&M*).

| Solid state *                 | This class was taught by Valery Pokrovsky and convinced me to go into theory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ✓     | P       |

| Deep learning *               | I thought this would be more theory.

| Numerical methods             | I don't even remember what I did in this class besides Newton's method.

| **QFT** *                     | To be honest, in my first pass of QFT, I did the calculations, but did not really understand what was going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ✓✓    | P       |
| Parallel computing            | Not too useful, but an interesting topic.

| String theory *               | I took string theory with Katrin Becker. It was genuinely a great course and I wish I had more mathematical development when I took it. Funnily enough, we followed Polchinski for most of the course before pivoting hard to flux compactifications towards then end.                                                             | ✓✓    | P       |

**Graduate**

The graduate classes were all useful in some extent. They were either good refreshers or I chose to take them for my own curiosity. Therefore, I'll just list them.

- E&M
- QM
- QFT I, II
- String Theory I, II
- GR
- Quantum Info
- Standard Model/Particle Physics
- SUSY

I tested out of classical mechanics and stat mech.

I may sit in on some graduate math courses. Maybe algebraic geometry or some special topics courses.
