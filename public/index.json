Oftentimes, it seems like two parties are talking past each other and one has to wonder, \u0026ldquo;what is the point of this debate?\u0026rdquo;\nActually, this is a good question, what is the point of a debate? I think a possible categorization can be made by considering who the outcome of the debate will affect. For this, I think the following three categories will be sufficient:\nFrivolous debates: Debates whose outcomes will not meaningfully affect anyone. Personal debates: Debates whose outcomes will only affect the parties debating. Societal debates: Debates whose outcomes will affect more than just the parties debating. Maybe a better question I want to answer is the following: Using this categorization, when is it productive to have certain debates?\nWhat do I mean by productive? I mean a debate that will change the actions or affect at least one party or others.\nFrivolous debates #\rFrivolous debates are those that will not meaningfully affect anyone. These can be debates of opinion such as \u0026ldquo;I think this movie is better than this one\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I think \u0026lt;\u0026gt; is a better artist than \u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo;. Whether these debates are subjective or not is besides the point, the result of the debate will not change how either party behaves. These debates are not productive, but can be fun to have.\nMatters of opinion are not the only things that belong in this category. Debates that one would expect to be in the other two categories (Personal or Societal) can land in the Frivolous category in certain cases. This occurs when at least one of the parties are just talking past the other and have completely made up their mind beforehand. No matter what party A says or evidence it produces, party B will not acknowledge A\u0026rsquo;s points because B did not come in with the possibility of changing their mind. These debates are not productive, and are also infuriating to have.\nWhile not an implication, these types of debates usually do not need concrete pieces of evidence (historical, scientific, statistical, etc.) and even if they are presented, they are often not the defining pieces argument.\nIn either case, no one will change their behavior from this type of debate and it is not a productive endeavor. I want to emphasize that subjectivity of the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; answer in no way plays into this categorization.\nPersonal debates #\rPersonal debates are those whose outcomes will affect the parties debating. Many things fall into this category. For instance, maybe a friend debates with me to convince me I need to get more exercise. This affects me personally, but not anyone else in a meaningful way.\nI think most academic discussions fall into this category as well. Two parties want to solve or understand a common problem or concept, and the outcome will only affect the two parties. Maybe in changing how one or both parties choose to approach or explain the issue. Often, one can disagree on several points but concede, \u0026ldquo;in order to figure this out, we need to do this calculation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;we need to understand this point\u0026rdquo;,\nThese debates are productive and worth having because they will affect someone; however, they can quickly slip into being Frivolous. If party A presents a sufficient amount of evidence that any reasonable person could see that party B is wrong, or even if party B concedes the point, party B still has no obligation to act in accordance with what the debate was about. Just because all the evidence points to me having to exercise to stay healthy, I have no obligation to do so. While the discussion is not a productive one, I am perfectly in my right to not act and this is fine. It\u0026rsquo;s just that, in this case, the debate is frivolous.\nPersonal debates can have a broad spectrum of evidence to back them up. While statistics and reputable articles are still the gold standard, in certain cases, anecdotal evidence is still appreciated. Maybe party A says the best BBQ is a certain location but party B has been to several other locations and convinces A to go somewhere else which B thinks is the best.\nWhat may seem to be Personal or Frivolous debates can often slip into Societal debates. This happens for issues in which personal beliefs or tendencies are reflected in policies when that person votes or places an active role in a position that affects other people. The reason to be mindful about this transition is Societal debates require stronger evidence than Personal (and certainly Frivolous) debates.\nIf a CEO is convinced anecdotally that 5'6\u0026quot; people work the hardest, that is their right. But if they start selecting only 5'6\u0026quot; employees, the burden of proof is much higher. If you try and convince a friend that scientific investment is useless/necessary, that is a societal debate; they can go on to vote for either of those things.\nSocietal debates #\rSocietal debates are perhaps the scariest as the outcomes affect others. Political debates would fall into a (perhaps large) subclass of Societal debates. Of course, as mentioned in the previous section, these debates do not just occur by those in power, they also occur in our everyday lives and affect our everyday lives, even if not apparent. After voting, maybe the current economy as a product of the government forces your company to produce layoffs, or maybe congress cuts the budget of a key program. In a functioning democracy, even inaction as an outcome is an action.\nWhen debating things that could change people\u0026rsquo;s lives, the highest standard of evidence is required. This should be well respected, peer studied articles, statistics, or historical events. Anecdotes should not suffice to make decisions for other people as one\u0026rsquo;s personal experience can be skewed. A rather famous example is that in 2025, roughly half of Americans thought crime in America was worse than in 2024 (see this Gallup poll) while the FBI statistics show a 4.5% decrease.\nIf two parties cannot agree on the facts and statistics, a productive societal debate cannot occur. Partially, this is why I think live debates are usually not productive. These statistics are not things one should memorize, but cite as needed. In the heat of a debate, one can forget such facts or statistics or simply not know them. In bad faith live debates, one can cite a skewed or made up statistic and both parties just have to take it as given.\nIt is often the case that these debates occur not to convince the parties debating, but to convince spectators. This too seems to be poor practice. Just because one forgets evidence or is just a bad debater, does not mean their point is wrong. Just because one is charismatic in a debate does not mean they are right. In an ideal world, the spectators would take just the points of the parties, not their appearance, nor their demeanor, and fact check them or critically think about these points.\nAcademics, (ex. Political and Economic theorists) rarely argue their points in front of a live audience. There is too much to keep track of and it is not a productive when topics are nuanced and take time to digest. Instead, they spread ideas and respond to each other with papers or in depth discussions that take time. Indeed, time is probably one of the biggest factors in having a productive Societal debate.\nWhen the federalists were debating the ratification of the constitution in the late 1780\u0026rsquo;s, their primary tool was the Federalist Papers, a series of articles and essays in favor of the constitution. These were published in newspapers and gave both opponents and supporters time to digest and respond to the papers.\nIn some form, I guess I am advocating that Societal debates should be relegated to pen and paper or in long terms discussions where both parties can discuss the evidence and validity of the evidence for their points.\nWhat do we gain? #\rWhat do we gain from the above construction? From the categorization, and the classification of evidence? Well, before committing to a debate, it is productive to consider which type of debate you are getting into. A priori you know what type of evidence you need to produce and how seriously you need to take the debate.\nIf it is a Frivolous debate, (even if pretending to be one of the others), it is not worth taking it seriously. You know it will not be a productive conversation as no one will change their mind. If it is a Societal debate, you know to have a productive conversation, you will need time and reputable evidence.\nIt is an excellent idea to clarify with who you are debating with what kind of debate you are having. Maybe not in terms of the above classification, but just ask, \u0026ldquo;Why are we debating this point?\u0026rdquo;\nTo conclude, before you get into an argument, consider its purpose, whether it can be productive, and what evidence you need to justify you point.\n","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/opinions/debates/","section":"Posts","summary":"A categorization for debates #\rIn recent times, both personally and in the public discourse, there has been a significant focus on debates regarding current events.","title":"What is the point of a debate?","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/yasin/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Yasin","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"19 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/coding/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Coding","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rThis is a companion piece to my friend\u0026rsquo;s post where they talk more about the coding side of this project. I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning algebraic topology recently for a variety of physics reasons and came upon this theorem.\nThe project can be found here: https://borsuk-ulam-tp.streamlit.app/\nColombia and Borneo sometimes have the same temperature #\rRecently, for a variety of reasons I\u0026rsquo;ll get into later, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten interested in learning algebraic topology. While going through this series of lectures, I found one interesting result to be the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. It says for a continuous map $$f:S^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n , ~\\exists x \\in S^n \\text{ s.t. }f(x)=f(-x).$$ What does this mean in laymen\u0026rsquo;s terms?\n\\(f\\) is a function that eats coordinates on a sphere (say longitude and latitude on Earth) and spits out two numbers (say temperature and pressure). Essentially, if we let \\((\\theta,\\phi) \\) be coordinates on Earth, $$f(\\theta,\\phi) = (T,P)~,$$ then we are guaranteed by Borsuk-Ulam that there are at least two points on opposite sides of the planet have the same temperature and pressure. The title is an allusion to the fact that (at the time of this post) there seems to be a matching between east Colombia and west Borneo that happens relatively often.\nNote that temperature and pressure aren\u0026rsquo;t special here, it\u0026rsquo;s just the mandatory example that must be covered every time Borsuk-Ulam is brought up in a class.\nCrucially, the proof of this theorem isn\u0026rsquo;t constructive, it just asserts that there exists a point \\(x\\) on the sphere that does this.\nAfter the lecture, I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;well, it seems like you could code something up to actually find these points for you,\u0026rdquo; and I reached out to my friend to help me. We came up with a program that looks for these points (though honestly I was more there for emotional support). The project turned out even better than I imagined, starting its life as a jupyter notebook and then ending up as a program with an entire dashboard.\nYou can learn more about the code and some troubles we faced on his blog. For now, I promised to cover some math.\nA (sketch of the) proof for the circle #\rI\u0026rsquo;ll try to sketch a proof with as little complicated math as possible. At the very least, one can understand the baby example (\\(f:S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) ) with just some knowledge of calculus 1.\nSome notation here. \\(S^1\\) is just the regular old circle. So we are looking for (continuous) functions (basically functions that you can draw without taking your pen off the page) that take in a coordinate of the circle \\(\\theta\\) and spit out a number \\(f(\\theta)\\). An example would be \\(f(\\theta) = \\sin \\theta\\) .\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take \\(x\\) to be a point on the circle and \\(-x\\) to be a point on the opposite side. In practice, we would take \\(x=\\theta\\) and \\(-x = \\theta+\\pi\\) (180 degrees around the circle).\nWe want to show that there exists a point \\(x\\) such that \\( f(x) = f(-x)\\). Let us define $$g(x) := f(x) - f(-x).$$ Here is the key insight: note that when \\(f(x) = f(-x)\\), \\(g(x) = 0\\). Also note that $$g(-x) = f(-x) - f(x) = -g(x).$$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you pick a random point on the circle and find \\(g(x)\u0026gt;0\\).\nThe point \\(x\\) you chose does not satisfy \\(f(x) = f(-x)\\).\nBut on the opposite side of the circle, we know \\(g(-x) = -g(x) \u0026lt; 0\\).\nSo our function \\(g\\) went from positive on the circle to negative on the circle, which means that at some point, it must have crossed 0 (intermediate value theorem) somewhere along the circle. \\(\\Box\\)\nIn the gif above, I picked a random function that has sines and cosines. a point and its antipode are plotted. The green line is the function \\(g(x)\\) and when it hits zero, we can see that the circle lights up green.\nA (not even sketch of the) proof for the sphere #\rThe sphere case is analogous, though a bit harder. There are a number of ways to prove it. Instead of covering it, I\u0026rsquo;ll just point to 3blue1brown\u0026rsquo;s video which does a better job than I ever could and also has helpful visuals. It also has the benefit of showing how it could be useful in the real world.\nBecause my motivation is algebraic topology, I\u0026rsquo;ll give the punchline for the algebraic topology proof. The so called fundamental group \\(\\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}\\) measures how many ways there are to wrap a circle around a circle and come back to the point you started at. It is isomorphic to the integers.\nFor instance, \\( [0] \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) means no wrapping around the circle. \\( [1] \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) means to wrap around once counterclockwise and \\([-1]\\) clockwise. We can add these just like the integers, \\([1] + [1] = [2]\\), or just that wrapping around once 2 times is equivalent to wrapping around twice once. In other words: $$ 1+1=2.$$ If we assume that Borsuk-Ulam does not hold, it can be shown that you can only wrap around the circle an odd number of times, not an even number of times. This is obviously false, why would I only be able to go around the circle 1,3, or 5 times and not twice? Thus, Borsuk-Ulam must hold \\(\\Box\\).\n","date":"19 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/compsci/borsuk-ulam/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is a companion piece to my friend\u0026rsquo;s post where they talk more about the coding side of this project.","title":"Colombia and Borneo sometimes have the same temperature+pressure","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"19 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/physics-nt/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Physics-Nt","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/physics-t/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Physics-T","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rWhy care? #\rSymmetries are a guiding principle in physics. They give us an extreme amount of control which we can use to make predictions. A particular class of symmetries called gauge symmetries are especially important. They are used to describe the physics of forces. This included electromagnetism, the strong and weak force, and even gravity.\nIn certain cases, gauge symmetries can be anomalous. That is, symmetries at a classical level, may not be symmetries at a quantum level. This is a massive issue.\nGauge symmetries are not \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; symmetries, they are redundancies in description. As an example, in electromagnetism, shifting the vector potential\n$$ \\vec{A} \\to \\vec{A}\u0026rsquo;=\\vec{A} + \\nabla \\lambda$$ does not change the magnetic field $$\\vec{B} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}.$$ If the gauge symmetry is broken, there is something seriously wrong with the theory and it cannot be consistent.\nIn quantum field theory, anomalous gauge symmetries lead to probabilities bigger than one. This means the theory is sick and cannot be consistent as is. In a nutshell, symmetries give us conserved currents (see Noether\u0026rsquo;s theorem) This means the divergence of the current should be 0 At a quantum level, these currents may not be conserved (divergence is non-zero) The divergence of the currents is proportional to the charges of the particles The standard model has gauge symmetries as well. For the standard model to be a \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; theory, all of its gauge symmetries must not be anomalous. Hopefully by the end of this you can see why the standard model has the charges it does.\nClassical and quantum symmetries #\rFor the rest of this, we will pass to a description of quantum field theory. First let us talk about classical symmetries. A simple example is with quantum electrodynamics (where I will drop the \\(F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) term. The Lagrangian is given by\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\bar \\psi(i \\gamma^\\mu[\\partial_\\mu + ieA_\\mu]-m)\\psi .$$ Here, \\(\\psi, \\bar \\psi\\) are the fermions (electrons/positrons fields) and \\(A_\\mu\\) is the electromagnetic four-potential (the photon), and \\(e\\) is the charge of the electron.\nClassical symmetries #\rThis Lagrangian has a classical \\(U(1) \\) symmetry. This means it is invariant under the following transformation:\n$$\\psi(x) \\to \\psi\u0026rsquo;(x)=e^{ie\\lambda(x)} \\psi(x), \\quad \\bar \\psi(x) \\to \\bar \\psi\u0026rsquo;(x)=e^{-ie\\lambda(x)} \\bar \\psi(x), \\quad A_\\mu(x) \\to A_\\mu\u0026rsquo;(x)=A_\\mu(x)-\\partial_\\mu \\lambda.$$ Not the fermions transform with a phase proportional to their charge \\(e\\). In terms of the action, $$ S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L} \\to S\u0026rsquo; = S + \\delta S = S.$$Let us check this. Doing the transformation,\n$$\\mathcal{L}\u0026rsquo;= e^{-ie\\lambda} \\bar \\psi(i \\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu + ie\\gamma^\\mu(A_\\mu-\\partial_\\mu \\lambda)-m)e^{ie\\lambda} \\psi$$ Simplifying, we get\n$$=i(e^{-ie\\lambda} \\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu (e^{ie\\lambda} \\psi(x)) -e\\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu (A_\\mu-\\partial_\\mu \\lambda) \\psi -m\\bar \\psi \\psi$$ $$=i \\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi -e\\bar \\psi\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu \\lambda \\psi - e \\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu A_\\mu +e\\bar \\psi\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu \\lambda \\psi - m \\bar \\psi \\psi$$ $$=i \\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi - e \\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu A_\\mu - m \\bar \\psi \\psi=\\mathcal {L}.$$ We have returned to the same Lagrangian. Note that the charges of the electrons and positrons are chosen in such a way to cancel the \\(e\\) in front of the photon field \\(A_\\mu\\). I could not have chosen \\(0.5 e\\) or \\(2e\\).\nOne could ask, \u0026ldquo;If I scale the charges together, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t the Lagrangian be gauge inveriant?\u0026rdquo; Indeed it would, scaling all the charges together is fine. But imagine if there were more gauge fields and matter fields, all interacting with each other with their own charges. If you scale one set of charges and not other, you may ruin the gauge invariance of another term. With many fields, choosing the correct charges is hard already at the classical level.\nTo this symmetry, there is an associated current (you can think about it as the analog of electric current), given by Noether\u0026rsquo;s theorem\n$$ j^\\mu = \\bar \\psi \\gamma^\\mu \\psi.$$ It\u0026rsquo;s fine if you don\u0026rsquo;t know where this comes from, the important part is it can be checked that on the equations of motion, the current is conserved, i.e.\n$$\\boxed{\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu = 0.}$$ We can take this to mean the symmetry is fine.\nIf the current is not conserved (\\(\\partial_\\mu j^\\mu \\neq 0\\) ), then the symmetry is broken. Quantum symmetries #\rWhat would imply the gauge symmetry is broken at the quantum level? Well, all we would need to do is throw the divergence of the current into a correlator\n$$\\boxed{\\langle \\partial_\\mu j^\\mu \\rangle \\neq 0 \\implies \\text{Broken symmetry}.}$$ In quantum field theory, we can concretely compute these and see whether the symmetry is fine or not.\nThey are given by triangle Feynman diagrams. An alternative way of viewing this is through the path integral (essentially just a partition function). For a symmetry to be non-anomalous, the partition function must be invariant under the gauge transformation\n$$ Z \\to Z\u0026rsquo; = Z.$$The path integral tells us to integrate over all configurations of the fields\n$$ Z = \\int D\\psi D\\bar \\psi D A_\\mu e^{iS[\\psi,\\bar \\psi, A]}.$$ Under the gauge transformation,\n$$Z \\to Z\u0026rsquo; = \\int D\\psi\u0026rsquo; D\\bar \\psi\u0026rsquo; D A_\\mu\u0026rsquo; e^{iS[\\psi\u0026rsquo;,\\bar \\psi\u0026rsquo;, A\u0026rsquo;]},$$ but the action is invariant under the gauge transformations so $$ Z\u0026rsquo; = \\int D\\psi\u0026rsquo; D\\bar \\psi\u0026rsquo; D A_\\mu\u0026rsquo; e^{iS[\\psi,\\bar \\psi, A]}.$$ From this perspective, we can chalk up anomalies to be due to the non-invariance of the measure under gauge transformations $$ \\text{if } D\\psi\u0026rsquo; D\\bar \\psi\u0026rsquo; D A_\\mu\u0026rsquo; \\neq D\\psi D\\bar \\psi D A_\\mu \\implies \\text{Broken symmetry}.$$\nAnomaly coefficients #\rEarlier we mentioned\n$$\\langle \\partial_\\mu j^\\mu \\rangle \\neq 0 \\implies \\text{Broken symmetry}.$$ There is a general form of this quantity. The left-hand side is always proportional to the anomaly coefficient.\n$$\\langle \\partial_\\mu j^\\mu \\rangle \\simeq \\sum_{LH}\\text{gauge charge}-\\sum_{RH}\\text{gauge charge}$$ Let us break this up:\nThe gauge charges are essentially just the charges of the particles we are talking about under the specific gauge group. The sum over LH and RH mean to only sum over the charges of the left hand or right handed fermions. For the symmetry to be non-anomalous, the sums of the charges must cancel. For QED, we wrote the Lagrangian in terms of a Dirac spinor. This means that $$\\psi = \\psi_L + \\psi_R$$ so every left handed fermion comes with a right handed fermion. We now have all the information we need to make sure the \\(U(1)\\) symmetry in QED is non-anomalous.\nFirst let us write the charges. We only have to worry about the fermions \\(\\psi\\).\nField U(1) charge \\(\\psi_L\\) e \\(\\psi_R\\) e For a triangle diagram, we need to insert 3 charges. In terms of anomaly coefficients, this means we cube the charges $$\\boxed{\\langle \\partial_\\mu j^\\mu \\rangle \\simeq \\sum_{LH}Q_l^3-\\sum_{RH}Q_r^3 = e^3 - e^3 =0.}$$ So now we have found that the \\(U(1)\\) gauge symmetry survives at the quantum level! A few notes\nQED is \u0026ldquo;non-chiral\u0026rdquo;. This means there are the same number of left handed and right handed fermions and then have the same charges. Therefore, it is no surprise that the anomaly cancelled. We only get the relevant gauge anomalies we are talking about when the theory is \u0026ldquo;chiral\u0026rdquo;. The Standard Model #\rAbove we just saw that chiral theories have the possibility of being anomalous. The Standard Model has gauge group\n$$SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$$ and is may be dangerously anomalous. Only the left handed fermions transform under \\(SU(2)\\). We now write the charges.\nField SU(3) SU(2) U(1) \\(Q_L^i\\) 3 2 1/6 \\(u_R^i\\) 3̅ 1 2/3 \\(d_R^i\\) 3̅ 1 -1/3 \\(L_L^i\\) 1 2 -1/2 \\(e_R^i\\) 1 1 -1 Here, the first 3 rows are the left handed and right handed quarks. The last 2 rows are the left handed and right handed leptons. The bolded numbers are not charges in the same way as they were in the \\(U(1)\\) case, they denote how the fields transform under the non-abelian symmetries. Remember that anomalies are given by triangle diagrams and all of these diagrams must be non-anomalous. This means we have to check every combination of 3 currents and every single combination must be non-anomalous, else the standard model would be dead. This would look like checking [SU(3)SU(3)SU(3)], [SU(2)SU(2)SU(2)], [SU(2)SU(2)U(1)], [U(1)U(1)U(1)], etc.\nAs a sample calculation, let us check that \\(U(1)^3\\) hypercharge is non-anomalous.\n$$\\langle \\partial_\\mu j^\\mu \\rangle \\simeq \\sum_{LH} Y^3 - \\sum_{RH} Y^3 .$$ Here \\(Y\\) are the charges.\nThe difficulty is in the sum over fermions. For example, naively one would thing the contribution of the left handed quarks is just \\((1/6)^3\\). This is not that case. There are multiple quarks because there are charged under the other gauge groups. The contribution would instead be\n$$3 \\text{ generations} \\times 3 \\text{ from SU(3)} \\times 2 \\text{ from SU(2)} \\times \\left(\\frac16\\right)^3 = \\frac{3}{36}.$$ Hopefully it is clear that the counting can be complicated. Let us go back now.\n$$\\sum_{ferm} Y^3 = 3\\cdot(3\\cdot2\\cdot Y_Q^3 + 2 \\cdot Y_L^3 -(Y_{e}^3 + 3\\cdot Y_u^3 +3 \\cdot Y_d^3)$$ $$= 3(3\\cdot2\\cdot (1/6)^3 + 2 \\cdot (-1/2)^3 -((-1)^3 + 3\\cdot (2/3)^3 +3 \\cdot (-1/3)^3)$$\n$$\\boxed{=0}$$\nSo the [U(1)U(1)U(1)] current is in fact non-anomalous. We still have to check all the other combinations too. The non-abelian calculations are a bit different but the spirit of the calculation is the same.\nIt is a miracle that all the anomalies of the Standard Model cancel. Better yet, to describe the underlying physics we know and observe, there is nothing else we could right down in terms of the charges (up to rescaling everything).\nThe left handed quarks don\u0026rsquo;t have hypercharge 1/6 because we want them to, they have hypercharge 1/6 because if they didn\u0026rsquo;t, the anomaly would not cancel. It is a very important note that the electric charges come from the \\(SU(2) \\times U(1) \\) symmetry. Once we fix our units, this is of course something that we can observe.\nWe can establish the fractional charges of quarks beyond reasonable doubt due to proton-electron collisions such as those at SLAC.\nHopefully it is clear how non-trivial anomaly cancellation is and how they can lead to real predictions. There are most comments that one can find in my blog post here as well as some non-abelian calculations.\n","date":"14 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/anomalies/what-everyone-should-know-anomalies/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why care?","title":"What every physicist should know about (gauge) anomalies","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rEnd of classes #\rI have just crowned the list of classes I have taken in my academic career with supersymmetry and I won\u0026rsquo;t be taking any other class. It feels weird to come to the end of this journey, especially when one has been taking college classes for the better part of 5 years, and in school for more than two decades.\nA physics degree consists of playing catch up to modern day physics. We start by learning classical mechanics (1700s) then moving on to electromagnetism (mid 1800s) and then quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics (early 1900s). Quantum field theory takes us to the 1950s and on to around the 1970s. If one takes a string theory class, they learn about topics from the 1980\u0026rsquo;s onward (maybe to 1997 with AdS/CFT).\nThus, it is a nice ending point for classes (for which the community should have widespread agreement on material) when the supersymmetry class ends with the duality cascade (2004). So with this class, we are finally taken into the current millennium.\nOn the bright side, I will no longer have to worry about exams, homework, or grades. At the end of the day, the classes were starting to get in the way of research, and anything I need to learn I feel comfortable teaching myself at this point.\nWhile I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to take any courses for credit (or any current physics classes), I do still plan on sitting in on interesting math classes relevant to my research. Luckily, UT makes this very easy to do.\nA retrospective on classes #\rIn these 5 years, I\u0026rsquo;ve taken a lot of classes, Some of them were very useful, some of them were not (most of the computer science classes). I thought it may be fun to go through and make a table.\nIs this a flex that I have 2 degrees? Yes, because that is the only use for my CS degree now.\nThis is roughly in chronological order. When the class name is not enough, there is a description. Classes that are 2 semesters are only listed once and bolded (ex E\u0026amp;M 1 and 2 are listed as just E\u0026amp;M).\nUndergraduate\n✓ : Useful X : Why did I have to take this? : If the field is left blank, it is neutral * : Grad course Physics (P), computer science is (CS), both is (B) Class Description Worth Subject Discrete Math First exposure to formal proofs and real math.. ✓ CS Diff EQ ✓ P Waves/Optics University Physics 3 essentially tuned for phycisists. ✓ P Engineering lab Just python 101.

In essence, this is saying that all of the fields in the complement region are generated by just taking the fields you have in the current region and taking a commutant.\nGenerally, Haag Duality is taken to be a sense of a sensible \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; theory. Jon and friends wrote a paper about this quite recently. Most nice theories we know of (free scalar, E\u0026amp;M, etc.) obey this condition.\nThe Problem #\rIn some work on an upcoming paper, me and some collaborators found that when we constructed diffeomorphism invariant observables by dressing with the modular Hamiltonian, Haag duality was broken.\nAt first I thought I must have done a calculation wrong for our setup, but going back into the literature (Witten, JSS, and KLS ) this turns out to just be a general feature of this type of dressing. For some reason this hasn\u0026rsquo;t been caught up until now and no one has made any comments about this (at least to my knowledge).\nAn easy place to see this is in KLS with the AdS-Schwarzschild geometry. They find the von Neumann algebra of the right region, \\(\\mathfrak{A}(\\mathcal R) \\) (Eq. 4.44) and its commutant \\(\\mathfrak{A}(\\mathcal R) ' \\) (Eq. 4.46). It is easy to directly construct \\(\\mathfrak{A}(\\mathcal L)\\), the algebra of the left region. The issue is\n$$\\mathfrak{A}(\\mathcal L) \\neq \\mathfrak{A}(\\mathcal R)'.$$\nThis seems to be an issue. In many many papers, both in QFT and especially holography, Haag duality is just assumed because it seems like such a physical and sensible property.\nMaybe it makes sense that it broken? Dressing with the modular Hamiltonian seems to be quite non-local. In terms of geometric modular flow, this usually looks like conjugating by an operator that is the stress-energy tensor integrated over a non-trivial region. It is worth wondering if Haag duality is broken no matter what we dress.\nHopefully there is some resolution to this we are just missing. Maybe we missed something that happens with the double commutant to fix this, I am not sure. There is an IAS conference coming up on Algebras in about 2 weeks where we plan to bring this up and hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll get comments there.\nIf Haag duality is actually broken, this seems like a problem.\nUpdate (Nov 17th) #\rWhen we specify a von Neumann algebra, we require the following data: (\\(\\mathcal A, \\pi, \\mathcal H \\)). Here these objects are the abstract algebra, a representation of that algebra, and a Hilbert space on which the algebra acts on respectively. At the level of the abstract algebras, \\( \\mathcal A(\\mathcal R ') \\neq \\mathcal A(\\mathcal R)' \\); however, we can get these algebras to match is we first do a unitary transformation with the modular Hamiltonian and the left sided timeshift operator, and then a relabeling of the \\( L^2(\\mathbb R) \\) Hilbert space from the right to left.\nThe algebras at a von Neumann algebra level are isomorphic, but not unitarily equivalent. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird, usually when Haag duality is talked about, one does not change the Hilbert space. The transformation above essentially takes $$ \\mathcal F \\otimes L^2(\\mathbb R)_R \\to \\mathcal F_{QFT} \\otimes L^2(\\mathbb R)_L .$$\n","date":"16 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/algebra/haag-duality/","section":"Posts","summary":"Haag Duality #\rHaag Duality is the statement that, for some region \\(\\mathcal O\\), the algebra of observables in that region, \\(\\mathcal A(\\mathcal O)\\) satisfy","title":"Breaking Haag Duality","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rThere are many systems in the quantum world which have no classical analogues. There is still ample reason to care about these systems. One example of this is the humble qubit system which takes two values: spin up or spin down.\nFamously, it is difficult to explain spin as there is no classical analogue. The common trope goes, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s like a spinning ball, except it\u0026rsquo;s not spinning, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a ball.\u0026rdquo; Obviously, study of such a system is relevant to quantum computers which we can actually make.\nClassical Systems #\rIn physics, given some system we want to describe, say a ball that someone has thrown, we like to write down concrete expressions governing it\u0026rsquo;s dynamics. In simple terms, we like to write down $$\\vec F = m \\vec a ~,$$ the equations of motion. In the case of the thrown ball, this gives us a simple differential equation that anyone that has taken calculus 1 can solve: $$0 = m \\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} , \\quad mg = m \\frac{d^2y(t)}{dt^2}$$ where \\(x(t),y(t) \\) describe the balls motion.\nWhen forces are conservative, it is often much more useful to use the Lagrangian formalism. The Lagrangian is nothing but the kinetic energy minus potential energy $$ \\mathcal L = KE - PE .$$ In the example above, this would be nothing but $$\\mathcal L = \\frac12 m \\left(\\dot x^2 + \\dot y^2\\right) - mgy~.$$\nIn fact, to solve for the equations of motion, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equations: $$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\dot y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{d y}, \\quad \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\dot x}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{d x}~.$$ It is easy to check that these equations give the same differential equations that we wrote above using \\(F = ma\\). When systems get very complicated, it is easier to use the Lagrangian formalism (which deals with energy) than the Newtonian formalism (which deals with the forces directly). Of course, they yield the same result (the same EOM).\nQuantum systems #\rWhen we pass to quantum field theories, one largely does the same. We can write down a Lagrangian, then find it\u0026rsquo;s equations of motion. A field is just a function that takes a value at every point in space. For example, think of an electric field.\nThe simplest example one can construct is a 2d free massless scalar field. It is sufficient to think about it as a function that eats two coordinates and outputs a number \\(\\phi(t,x) = \\text{number} \\). Here the coordinates are time and space. The equation of motion is then $$\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi(t,x)}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi(t,x)}{\\partial x^2} .$$ This is nothing but the wave equation. In classical mechanics, if one were to solve for the the motion of a vibrating string, they would find the same thing $$\\frac{\\partial^2y(t,x)}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{T}{\\mu}\\frac{\\partial^2y(t,x)}{\\partial x^2} .$$ Here, \\(y(t,x)\\) is the position of the string and \\(T,\\mu\\) are the tension and mass per unit length respectively.\nThe Lagrangian that produced the wave equation for our field looks like $$\\mathcal L = -\\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t}\\right)^2 + \\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)^2.$$\nThe quantization procedure for a field (How to make this field a quantum object) is straight forward and not relevant to the discussion. What I want to convey is that, once given such a Lagrangian, there is a formulaic way to make sense of it in the quantum theory.\nWe can even add other terms to this Lagrangian, for example, $$\\mathcal L = -\\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial t}\\right)^2 + \\frac12\\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 + \\frac16\\lambda \\phi^3.$$ \\(\\lambda\\) is just some number that tells us how how far from the free theory the system is. The equation of motion would get modified to $$-\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi(t,x)}{\\partial t^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi(t,x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac\\lambda2 \\phi^2= 0 .$$ Classically, this makes complete sense; however, when we pass to the quantum description, we must perturb around the free solution. This means we need \\(\\lambda\\) to be small in order to make sense of the theory. In technical terms, the \u0026ldquo;perturbative theory\u0026rdquo; makes sense as a quantum theory when \\(\\lambda\\) is small and we call this \u0026ldquo;weakly coupled\u0026rdquo;.\nQuantum-non classical systems #\rIt would be nice if all the quantum field theory systems we cared about could be written with a perturbative description. Electromagnetism (at low energies) is such a theory. However, to describe what happens in an proton (with QCD) or strongly interacting condensed matter systems (like high temperature superconductors or quantum hall systems), we must study the strongly interacting theories ..\nThis makes our lives much harder, but can be done a variety of ways: numerically, RG arguments, or dualities between a strongly interacting theory and a weak one.\nDespite this, there are monsters hiding in the shadows. There exist theories that have no known (and indeed, cannot have a) perturbative description. These are in fact, the vast majority of quantum systems.\nThis means there is no sense in which one can write down a Lagrangian or even hope to get a good grasp of it\u0026rsquo;s dynamics using this formalism.\nAn example of these theories are quantum field theories in six dimensions. If one tries to write down a Lagrangian description, they quickly find that it fails as a quantum theory. The only way we know the six dimensional theories exist are because they come from string theory. These theories can be studied but are notoriously difficult.\nOne can actually reduce these theories to 4d and learn about properties of the 4d system which come from the 6d system. In some cases, the 4d theory can even be Lagrangian. This perspective is actually very useful to make sense of certain properties of the theories.\nFor example, regular old electrodynamics has an electromagnetic duality (If I swap electric and magnetic fields, things stay the same). One can ask, \u0026ldquo;why does this happen?\u0026rdquo; If we start with a particular 6d theory and compactify two dimensions to be a torus (a donut), the electromagnetic duality is inherited from properties of the torus. In this way, we can directly see where this electromagnetic duality comes from.\nSome closing remarks #\rMost systems one can think of actually don\u0026rsquo;t have a classical analogue. I mentioned the qubit and 6d theories but there are countless more.\nI recently gave a talk on the construction of these 6d SCFTs from the top down construction using IIB/M-Theory so this was fresh in my mind. The discussion here was the first 5 minutes of motivation. I thought I may be able to convey at least the motivation to a general lay audience via this post.\nI toyed with the idea of trying to explain the top down construction and ADE classification in a bit more detail but decided against it. I do not know if it can be done, but it certainly cannot be done by me.\n","date":"16 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/string-theory/classically-quantum/","section":"Posts","summary":"There are many systems in the quantum world which have no classical analogues.","title":"Classically quantum systems","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rSome naïve motivation #\rRecently I have been studying the \\(SL(2,\\mathbb Z)\\)-gravitational mixed anomaly of 4d free Maxwell theory. It can be shown as arising from the \\( 8 \\in H^2(BSL(2,\\mathbb Z),\\mathbb Z) = \\mathbb Z_{12}\\). Through some investigation, the group also shows the invertible phase in 3d that is left over, after applying the operation \\( (ST)^3 \\) on a boundary theory coupled to Maxwell in the bulk, is also related to this \\(8 \\in \\mathbb Z_{12}\\).\nIdeally, I wanted to do a computation on the boundary to show that the invertible phase that was left over is order 3, just like the anomaly in 4d free Maxwell. Instead, I ended up using a lot of fancy language for no reason to derive 3d Chern-Simons requires a gravitational part.\nAt some point I\u0026rsquo;ll probably email Tachikawa or one of my more knowledgeable friends about my original question.\nNotes: It should be said that in the way I approach the problem, I drop a lot of the dynamical data and only care about the phase of the partition functions. Also, it was naïve of me to convert back to differential forms or elements of some cohomology class (which are values in the integers) and expect to get something that is torsion. Really I should\u0026rsquo;ve just stuck with the Eta invariant. As an example, on certain Lens spaces, the expression I derive for the partition function relating to the 3d fermion is honest to god order 3.\nDerivation using APS theorem #\rLet us write the partition function of level 1 Chern-Simons following Hsieh, Tachikawa, and Yonekura. We must first pick a spin structure. Then we can split the gauge field into a sum of flat but topologicaly non-trivial part and a non-flat topologically trivial part. Assuming the flat connections are isolated, we have\n$$Z_{U(1) CS}(M_3) = \\left[\\int DA_{top,trivial}e^{\\pi i \\int (A/2\\pi) (F/2\\pi) }\\right] \\times \\left[\\sum_{A;flat}e^{\\pi i \\int (A/2\\pi) (F/2\\pi) }\\right]$$The first term can be written in terms of eta invariant of signature operator \\(*d\\)\n$$ \\exp\\left({-\\frac{2\\pi}{8} \\eta_{sig}}\\right)$$and the second term can be written\n$$\\exp\\left({2\\pi \\sum_{c\\in H^2(M_3,\\mathbb Z)} q(c) =: 2\\pi Arf(q)}\\right)$$ where \\(c = c_1(F)\\) is the first Chern class and \\(q(c)\\) is the exponentiaed level 1 classical action on a flat \\(A\\). One should take all the arguments of the expression above to be \\(\\mod \\mathbb Z\\).\nIt is known that\n$$ -\\frac18 \\eta_{sig} + Arf(q) = \\eta_{ferm}$$where the RHS is a invariant for the Dirac operator of a 2+1 d fermion with infinite mass.\nNow we use the APS theorem. In 3d, it says (see here) $$ -\\eta_{ferm} = \\int_{Z_4} \\left(\\frac12 F_A \\wedge F_A + \\hat A_1(R)\\right) \\mod \\mathbb Z.$$The RHS is the quadratic refinement and defined on a 4d manifold \\(Z_4\\) with boundary \\(Y_3\\) and the Eta invariant of the fermion is with respect to the Dirac operator in 3d \\(Y_3\\).\nThus, our level one CS theory partition function is solved as $$Z_{U(1)CS}(M_3) = \\exp{2\\pi i \\eta({D}_{Y_3})}$$ so through APS:\n$$Z_{U(1)CS}(M_3) =\\exp\\left(-2\\pi i\\int_{Z_4} \\frac{1}{2} F_A \\wedge F_A + \\hat A_1(R)\\right).$$ Concretely, the A-roof is just the 4-form part of the expansion in terms of Pontryagin classes\n$$ \\hat A_1(R) = -\\frac{1}{24}p_1=\\frac{1}{24\\cdot 8\\pi^2} \\text{tr} (R \\wedge R). $$ So now, the integral over this \\(R^2\\) is essentially just the signature. Our theory basically splits up into a part that is \\(F \\wedge F\\) and \\(R \\wedge R\\). One should note that I have been loose with defining F as a form but in reality and in general it is an element of some cohomology class.\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t take these expressions as concrete. I have absolutely also been loose with factors of \\(2\\pi,i\\), etc.\nWe have done nothing #\rIt is nontrivial to show (but not too difficult using Wu classes) that\n$$ \\exp \\left(\\sim \\int_{Y_3} A \\wedge F \\right)= \\exp\\left(\\sim \\int_{Z_4} F \\wedge F\\right)$$ when \\(\\partial Z_4 = Y_3\\). Therefore, part of our partition function is just the \\(CS(A)\\) term that one would expect.\nOne can similarly show\n$$ \\exp \\left(\\sim \\int_{Y_3} CS(\\omega) \\right)= \\exp\\left(\\sim \\int_{Z_4} \\text{Tr} R \\wedge R\\right)$$ where \\(\\omega\\) is the connection for the \\(SO(n)\\) tangent bundle of the manifold and\n$$CS(\\omega) = \\text{Tr}~ \\omega \\wedge d\\omega + \\frac{2}{3} \\omega \\wedge \\omega \\wedge \\omega.$$ Note that \\(R = d\\omega + \\omega \\wedge \\omega) \\) and the reader is free to verify \\(d CS(\\omega) \\sim R^2\\) as one would expect.\nNote that at the very least we did the path integral and ended up with an invertible phase as expected.\nPhysically what did we do? #\rWe knew there was a duality between Chern-Simons theories and fermions on its boundary. We split the Chern-Simons partition function into Eta and Arf invariants and used the fact that it is equal to the Eta invariant of a fermion. Then we used the APS theorem to rewrite the Eta invariant in terms of characteristic classes which we rewrote in terms of their boundary expressions.\nWe just derived that in order for Chern-Simons to be well defined, we need a gravitational CS term. This is a simple fact that any condensed matter theorist or high energy theorist could have told you without this machinery, but at least we can be assured the APS theorem and duality holds.\n","date":"30 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/anomalies/csplusaps/","section":"Posts","summary":"Some naïve motivation #\rRecently I have been studying the \\(SL(2,\\mathbb Z)\\)-gravitational mixed anomaly of 4d free Maxwell theory.","title":"A fancy way of deriving triviality","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/teaching/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Teaching","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rRecently, during another procrastination episode, me and some colleagues got into a discussion on the correct way to teach undergraduate quantum mechanics. There seems to be a \u0026ldquo;canonical\u0026rdquo; way to teach classical mechanics and electromagnetism, but there are multiple approaches to teaching quantum.\nFor classical mechanics, it is very clear that one should start with Newton\u0026rsquo;s laws, distill some intuition within the students, and then move on to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. This seems to be the approach in both graduate and undergraduate courses (with the graduate course maybe having some more special topics like chaos).\nThe books that follow this approach also usually follow this.\nSimilarly for electromagnetism, the standard undergrad textbook, Griffiths E\u0026amp;M, does a phenomenal job of ordering things in a way that makes sense. Start off with Coulombs law and electrostatics, talk about the electrics fields, potentials, and then the magnetic fields. There is usually ample time to draw analogues to classical mechanics (for example, Coulombs law with Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of gravitation). Then unify them with Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s equations to give a beautiful introduction to electrodynamics.\nThese two approaches are standard, and you will be hard pressed to find courses that vary from this point of view. This is not the case for quantum mechanics.\n\u0026ldquo;Canonical\u0026rdquo; approaches to quantum mechanics #\rThere are usually two (three) approaches to quantum mechanics:\nWave function first (like Griffith\u0026rsquo;s Quantum) Take the PDE approach to QM. Immediately start with Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s equation and how to solve it. Discuss things like infinite potential wells and the wavefunction \\(\\Psi(x)\\) as a state. Spin first (like Sakurai) Talk about spin and Stern-Gerlach first . Immediately start with Dirac notation \\(\\ket{\\Psi}\\) as a state and matrix representations. The historical approach (like Weinberg) Discuss the ultraviolet catastrophy, electrons in an atom, the photoelectric effect, etc. I say there are two approaches because this one usually leads to the wave function interpretation first. Weinberg, (whos opinion I must care about only because his office is in front of mine) uses de Broglie to talk about wave packets first which gives a natural flow into the wave function. Any good physicist should know all three. By the end of any good course, one should know the above and the other canonical topics (harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, perturbation theory, etc.). What I mean by \u0026ldquo;approaches\u0026rdquo; is how the course gives intuition and first impressions.\nOf the three, we all agreed that the wave function first approach a la Griffith\u0026rsquo;s is the worst. The statement of Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s equation is abrupt and from a mid quantum course, a student can come away thinking that quantum mechanics is just solving PDEs. I think it is difficult to discuss entanglement in this scenario and one can\u0026rsquo;t even discuss the humble qubit.\nUnfortunately, it seems like Griffith\u0026rsquo;s QM is the standard undergraduate text in the US. It takes almost 100 pages to even introduce kets and I think this confuses students who have been instilled with the wavefunction first.\nGriffiths says a state is \\(\\Psi(x) = \\braket{x|\\psi}\\) which \u0026ldquo;lives in a Hilbert space\u0026rdquo;, but this is misleading at best. \\(\\bra{x}\\) is not part of any Hilbert space. Despite this, the wavefunction works as a state in the algebraic sense: It maps \\(\\Psi:x \\to \\mathbb C\\). More confusion is introduced alongside density matrices (\\(\\rho\\)) which Sakurai calls states in addition to \\(\\ket{\\psi} \\in \\mathcal H\\). Technically he is right for the density matrices, you can represent a state, pure or mixed, as an operator on the algebra. This still seems disingenuous to me. One jumps through several hoops to avoid the mathematical rigour and reuses the word \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; for several different things. At best this is confusing, at worst, actually wrong. My gripe with both approaches is conveyed by my colleague very nicely here.\nThis is not supposed to be a technical post so let me move on.\nMy opinions #\rIn an ideal world, I would want to take the functional analysis and operator algebra approach to quantum mechanics. Here, one an rigorously defines states, observables, and measurement.\nI doubt this would be very popular among students. Maybe if they were motivated enough to learn the basics of quantum mechanics themselves, a course could start off with rigour. Graduate students are usually more motivated so it could happen there (next semester there is an \u0026ldquo;advanced SUSY\u0026rdquo; course being thought with the prerequisites as QFT I,II, almost all of Wess and Bagger, and some of Weinberg volume 3), but this would be unimaginable for an undergrad course.\nOut of the two options, I am partial to the spin first approach. I think it clearly introduces the \u0026ldquo;weirdness of quantum\u0026rdquo; in a simple concrete way that does not rely on difficult math. Conceptually, Stern-Gerlach and superposition can be explained to anyone that has the intuition coin flips are 50/50. My first introduction to quantum mechanics (and what got me interested in physics) was this MIT OCW lecture where the physics was abstracted out of the experiment and the spins were described as a particle being \u0026ldquo;black or white\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;hard or soft\u0026rdquo;. I have been told this analogy stems from Feynman.\nMoreover, this is the best approach if one wants to discuss quantum information, qubits, entanglement, etc. Mathematically, all that is required is some basic linear algebra and focus can be given to learning standard notation. Indeed, this is the approach that is even approachable to computer scientists and software engineers.\nAs for the historical approach, (good) physics undergrads should at least have been exposed to, or learned the historical aspects on their own or in a prior course. In many wave and optics courses (which contain thermodynamics as well), the ultraviolet and similar developments are covered. A short recap may be warranted but I think is unnecessary.\nStatistical mechanics and thermodynamics #\rThe fourth of the core classes is statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. I have taken 2 courses in it and neither I, nor anyone I know, have been given a satisfactory presentation of the course.\nDespite being arguably the oldest and most successful branch of physics, it is (imo) the worst taught. Most classes and books seem to take the historical approach and explain thermodynamics first, then hard pivot into a microscopic description with statistical mechanics. The microscopic description is usually easier; give me a partition function and I know everything. The connection with thermodynamics (heat engines, chemical reactions, gas equations) is difficult and I think unintuitive.\nIn the microscopic description, entropy has a clear state counting interpretation. In thermodynamics it is $$dS = \\frac{\\delta Q}{T} ~.$$ What?\nWhat is that supposed to mean intuitively?\nMaybe it is my ignorance as a physicist (and even worse, a high energy theorist), but thermodynamics is weird an unintuitive to me. Maybe a mechanical engineer or chemist would have a better intuition than me.\nSomehow when a bunch of degrees of freedom come together, we have a remarkably useful was to describe them using thermodynamics, even in cases when I don\u0026rsquo;t know the microscopic description. If a chemist asked me questions about chemical properties of ethanol and I told them to calculate a partition function, I would probably get smacked.\nIn conclusion, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what a good approach to teach statistical mechanics would be. The above colleague suggested an information theory approach may be useful.

The section on math can be entirely skipped.\nIn the previous post we found anomalies typically took the form $$ \\partial \\cdot J \\sim -\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2} \\text{Tr}~ (\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} F_{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\rho\\sigma})~ ,$$ where the \\(\\sim\\) denotes up to some number, say the number of massless fermions. These types of anomalies exist in all even dimensions \\(d=2n\\) and in general, we can write, with differential forms, $$ d* J = -\\frac{(-1)^n 2 N_f}{(2\\pi)^n n!} Q_{(2n)}~ . $$ Here, \\(Q_{(2n)}\\) is a \\(2n\\) form consisting of \\(n\\) 2 forms \\(\\mathcal F\\) $$Q_{(2n)} := \\text{Tr}~ (\\mathcal F \\wedge \\mathcal F \\wedge \\mathcal F \\cdots \\wedge \\mathcal F)~.$$ A few mathematical facts:\n\\(Q_{(2n)}\\) is closed. \\( dQ_{(2n)} = 0\\). Acting on \\(Q_{(2n)}\\) with \\(d\\) acts with the covariant derivative \\(D\\) inside the trace. Poincare Lemma: On topologically trivial manifolds, closed forms are exact. i.e. $$ d A_p =0 \\implies A_p = d B_{p-1} ~.$$ Note that while the equation relating the divergence of the anomalous current to \\(Q_{2n}\\) is only true in \\(d\\) dimensions, you can\u0026rsquo;t stop me from using \\(Q_{2n}\\) in whatever dimension I want. They are perfectly well defined. Restatement of the anomaly #\rIn the previous post, we found the non-abelian anomaly with chiral fermions to be\n$$ D \\cdot J^a = \\frac{-g^2\\mathcal Z^{abc}}{16\\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta} \\partial_\\mu \\left(A_\\nu^b\\partial_\\alpha A_\\beta^c - \\frac{g}{4}f^{cde}A_\\nu^bA_\\alpha^d A_\\beta^e\\right)$$ which we got by expanding \\(\\epsilon FF\\) and \\(\\mathcal Z^{abc}\\) contains the chiral traces. In differential form notation, this is\n$$ D * J^a = \\frac{-\\mathcal Z^{abc}}{32\\pi^2} d \\left(\\mathcal A^b \\wedge (d\\mathcal A + \\frac{i}{2} \\mathcal A \\wedge \\mathcal A)^c\\right) ~.$$\nOne should remember what we are doing when computing the current and making sure it\u0026rsquo;s divergence is 0. Under some symmetry transformation, say\n$$U(x) = 1 + i \\Lambda(x)~,$$\nwhere the gauge fields change as $$\\delta \\mathcal A = -D \\Lambda~,\\quad \\delta\\mathcal F = -i \\mathcal F \\Lambda + i \\Lambda \\mathcal F~,$$ The actions varies \\(S \\mapsto S + \\delta S(\\Lambda)\\) where for us,\n$$\\delta S(\\Lambda) = \\frac{-\\mathcal 1}{32\\pi^2} \\int_{M_4} \\text{Tr}_\\chi \\Lambda~ d \\left(\\mathcal A\\wedge (d\\mathcal A + \\frac{i}{2} \\mathcal A \\wedge \\mathcal A)^c\\right) ~. $$ Note that we have swept up the chiral traces \\(\\mathcal Z^{abc} \\) into the trace of the gauge fields.\nNow we have everything we need to continue.\nThe form of the argument #\rMinkowski/Euclidean space are topologically trivial. Anomaly descent is essentially an abuse of Poincare lemma. Even on nontrivial topologies, the lemma is still valid locally, though some more care is needed in the following arguments.\n\\( Q_{(2n)}\\) is closed $$dQ_{(2n)} = 0~,$$ so let us define $$ Q_{(2n)} = d \\Omega_{(2n-1)}~. $$ \\(\\Omega_{2n-1}\\) are the Chern-Simons forms. They are traces over polynomials of \\(\\mathcal F\\) and \\(\\mathcal A\\). \\(Q_{(2n)}\\) are gauge invariant \\( \\mathcal F \\mapsto U \\mathcal F U^{-1}\\), as one can easily see from using cyclicity of the trace. \\(\\Omega_{2n-1}\\ are not gauge invariant, but \\(d\\Omega_{2n-1}\\) must be by definition. So if I gauge transform the Chern-Simons form, the difference with the non-gauge transformed form better be 0. $$ d(\\Omega_{(2n-1)}\u0026rsquo; - \\Omega_{(2n-1)} ) =0$$ Again, we use Poincare lemma. The difference of the Chern-Simons forms is closed so $$\\Omega_{(2n-1)}\u0026rsquo; - \\Omega_{(2n-1)} = -d H_{(2n-2)}~.$$ \\(H_{(2n-2)}\\) should depend on \\(\\Lambda\\) and be a \\(2n-2\\) form. In general, they take the form of $$H_{(2n-2)} = \\text{Tr}(\\Lambda~ dK_{2n-3})~.$$ It actually does not take too much work to show this. Consider \\(Q_{(2)}\\). \\(\\Omega_{(1)} = \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A\\). Then $$\\Omega_{(1)}\u0026rsquo; - \\Omega_{(1)} = \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A\u0026rsquo; - \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A = \\text{Tr}~ (- D \\Lambda) = -d\\text{Tr}~ (\\Lambda)~ = -d H_{0}~.$$ One can continue playing the same game. For \\(n=2\\),\n$$\\Omega_{(3)} = \\text{Tr } (\\mathcal A \\wedge \\mathcal F - \\frac{i}{3} \\mathcal A \\wedge \\mathcal A \\wedge \\mathcal A), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H_{(2)} = \\text{Tr }(\\Lambda ~ d \\mathcal A)$$ and for \\(n=3\\) (this time dropping the wedges)\n$$\\Omega_{(5)} = \\text{Tr } (\\mathcal A \\mathcal F^2 - \\frac{i}{2} \\mathcal A^3 \\mathcal F - \\frac{1}{10} \\mathcal A^5), \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H_{(4)} = \\text{Tr }(\\Lambda ~ d( \\mathcal A d\\mathcal A + \\frac{i}{2} \\mathcal A^3))~.$$\n\\(H_{4}\\) should look very familiar. It is in fact (almost) the same shift of the Euclidean action $$\\delta S(\\Lambda) = (number) \\times \\int_{M_4} H_{(4)}~.$$ This is true for any (even) dimension. Start from a \\(Q_{(2n=d+2)}\\) form, then find the \\(\\Omega_{2n-1}\\) Chern-Simons form, then construct the \\(H_{(2n-2=d)}\\) which is the anomaly in \\(d\\) dimension! We see that it is almost entirely specified by the anomaly polynomial in 2 higher dimensions.\nSome details on the trace #\rThe trace in our original anomaly (going over the chiral fermions) and the trace in \\(H_{(2n-2)}\\) aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly the same. Nonetheless, we could have defined a new \\(2n\\) form with chiral traces (the so called anomaly polynomial)\n$$\\hat Q_{(2n)} := \\text{Tr}_\\chi (\\mathcal F \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\mathcal F) = \\mathcal F^{a_1} \\wedge \\mathcal F^{a_2} \\cdots \\wedge \\mathcal F^{a_n} \\times (\\text{Tr}_L(t^{a_1} \\cdots t^{a_n}) - \\text{Tr}_R(t^{a_1} \\cdots t^{a_n}))$$\nand the argument would not have changed from before.\nThe coefficients \\(\\mathcal Z^{a_1 a_2 a_3 \\cdots a_4}\\) from before which are built out of symmetrization of the chiral traces are essentially related to the Casimirs of degree \\(n = d/2+1\\), \\(R_n(m)\\).\nIn \\(d=4\\), we need the cubic Casimirs, which some groups do not have. In \\(d=2\\), we need quadratic casimirs which all groups do have, so getting automatic anomaly cancellation is not in the cards. In \\(d=6\\), there are 2 independent quartic invariants so anomaly cancellation is much harder. The situation in \\(d=10\\) is even worse.\nThe current plan is to present the index point of view. Then Green-Schwarz and anomaly inflow next before diving into the modern description of anomalies: Dai-Freed.\nMath and Subtleties #\rIn addition to Nakahara, we also have Bilal\u0026rsquo;s notes.\nWhy \\(\\Omega_{2n-1}\\)? #\r\\(Q_{(2n)}\\) is a characteristic class: a local form of the closed manifold constructed from the curvature or field strength such that the integral over the manifold \\(\\int_M Q\\) contains on topological data. In technical terms, characteristic classes measure the non-triviality of a bundle. It is in particular, an invariant polynomial (invariant under gauge transformations).\nBy the Chern-Weil theorem, \\(Q\\) is closed, but need not be globally exact. Though the difference between two invariant polynomials as exact \\(Q\u0026rsquo; - Q = d R\\). It can easily be seen that the integrals over two different invariant polynomials contain the same data $$\\int_M Q\u0026rsquo; - \\int_M Q = \\int_M dR = \\int_{\\partial M} R = 0~,$$ via Stokes.\nWe demand the integral of \\(Q\\) is invariant under deformations of \\(\\mathcal A\\). If one defines an interpolating gauge field $$\\mathcal A_t = \\mathcal A_0 + t(\\mathcal A_1- \\mathcal A_0) \\quad , \\quad \\mathcal F_t = d \\mathcal A_t + \\mathcal A_t^2~,$$ between two different connections, it can be shown (from taking the \\(\\partial_t\\) derivative and Bianchi) that\n$$R_{(2n-1)} = n \\int_0^1 dt \\text{Tr}~ (\\mathcal A_1- \\mathcal A_0) \\mathcal F_t^{n-1} $$ where \\(R\\) is the so called transgression. Then\n$$Q_{(2n)}(\\mathcal F_1) = Q_{(2n)}(\\mathcal F_0) + d \\left(n \\int_0^1 dt \\text{Tr } (\\mathcal A_1- \\mathcal A_0) \\mathcal F_t^{n-1} \\right)~.$$\nLocally, \\(Q = d \\Omega\\) and we can take \\(\\mathcal A_0=0\\)\n$$Q_{(2n)}(\\mathcal F_1) = d \\left(n \\int_0^1 dt \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A_1 \\mathcal F_1^{n-1} \\right)$$ and so we have found that the transgression is nothing but the Chern-Simons form\n$$ \\Omega_{(2n-1)} = n \\int_0^1 dt \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A \\mathcal F^{n-1} = n \\int_0^1 dt \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A_1 (t d \\mathcal A + t^2 \\mathcal A^2)^{n-1}~. $$\nNote the definition gives us the Chern-Simons form up to adding an exact form. As an example, let us compute \\(\\Omega_{(3)}\\). $$ \\Omega_{(3)} = 2 \\int_0^1 dt \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A (t d \\mathcal A + t^2 \\mathcal A^2) = \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A (d \\mathcal A + \\frac{2}{3} \\mathcal A^2) = \\text{Tr}~ \\mathcal A d \\mathcal F + \\frac{i}{3} \\mathcal A^3.$$\nWhy \\(H_{2n-2}\\)? #\rLocally we saw the infinitesimal gauge variation of the Chern-Simons form gave\n$$\\delta \\Omega_{(2n-1)} = -dH_{(2n-2)}~.$$ For a finite gauge transformation, it can be shown\n$$ \\Omega_{(2n-1)} (\\mathcal A\u0026rsquo;,\\mathcal F\u0026rsquo;) - \\Omega_{(2n-1)} (\\mathcal A,\\mathcal F) = \\Omega_{(2n-1)} ((dU)U^{-1},0) + d(\\cdots)~.$$ Physically\n$$\\int_{S^{2n-1}} \\Omega_{(2n-1)} ((dU)U^{-1},0) = \\int_{S^{2n-1}} \\text{Tr } ((dU)U^{-1})^{2n-1} $$computes the number of times \\(U: S^{2n-1} \\to G\\) maps the sphere to the topological sphere in G, i.e. computes the homotopy class \\(\\pi_{2n-1}(G)\\). For good Lie groups, the 3rd homotopy class is \\(\\mathbb Z\\), though for infinitesimal gauge transformations, it is always trivial.\nIn general, it can be shown that\n$$H_{(2n-2)}(\\Lambda, \\mathcal A, \\mathcal F) = n(n-1) \\int_0^1 dt (1-t) \\text{Tr } \\Lambda d(\\mathcal A \\mathcal F_t^{n-2})~,$$ though algebraically, for any gauge transformation (not just infinitesimal)\n$$\\Omega_{(2n-1)} (\\mathcal A + \\Lambda,\\mathcal F\u0026rsquo;) - \\Omega_{(2n-1)} (\\mathcal A,\\mathcal F) = H_{(2n-2)}(\\Lambda, \\mathcal A, \\mathcal F)~.$$\n","date":"27 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/anomalies/descent/","section":"Posts","summary":"This is a continuation of Some phenomenology of anomalies.","title":"A useful thing from 6d","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rI\u0026rsquo;ve recently gotten interested in anomalies for a variety of reasons and more specifically anomaly inflow, mostly due to an offshoot of a current project. But before diving into things from higher dimensions, SPT phases, and cancellations in depth, I wanted to ground myself in some observable effects.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t say anything new here. Most of what I cover can be found in more depth in Vadim\u0026rsquo;s notes and Quevado and Schachner\u0026rsquo;s notes the purpose of this is to rephrase things for my own understanding. Some Feynman diagrams are from there as well.\nGuide\nThe most technical part is QED.\nOn first pass it is good enough to read the physical consequences, baryon and lepton, and standard model sections.\nThe section for GS does not go into the mechanism, just discusses why it was a big deal.\nGlobal Anomalies #\rQED #\rWhile I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to derive the anomalies, it is worth saying some things about where they come from. Inevitably, the best place to start is QED (where we will unfortunately use Dirac spinors)\n$$ Z[A_\\mu] = \\int \\mathcal D \\Psi \\mathcal D \\bar \\Psi e^{-S_{QED}[\\Psi,\\bar \\Psi, A]} ~. $$ There is a famous axial anomaly corresponding to\n$$ \\Psi \\to e^{i \\theta \\gamma^5}\\Psi~, \\Psi^\\dagger \\to \\Psi^\\dagger e^{-i \\theta \\gamma^5} $$ such that the current \\(J^5\\) is not conserved past the classical level:\n$$\\langle \\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu5} \\rangle = \\langle\\partial_\\mu (\\bar \\Psi \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^5 \\Psi) \\rangle \\neq 0 ~.$$ In momentum space, this is just\n$$ q_\\mu \\text{Tr}( \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^5 S(p)) $$ where \\(S(p)\\) is the propagator for the spinor in the EM background. In terms of Feynman diagrams, this is: where the diagram with 0 external photons cancels by conservation of momentum \\(q=0\\), the ones with 1 or 3 photons cancel due to charge conjugation symmetry, and the diagrams with \\(n_\\gamma \u0026gt;3\\) we can cancel as their superficial degree of divergence shows they are no worse that log divergent. We can shift momenta such that diagrams will end up cancelling.\nAdding covariant higher derivative terms for the photon ( \\(\\mathcal L \\supset F (\\partial^2/\\Lambda^2)^n ) F\\) ), one can show (as ABJ did) that higher loop effects will cancel.\nThus, we are left with the conclusion that the axial anomaly is one loop exact. The only contributions come from the triangle diagrams we know and love. This is a big deal. Almost always the anomaly is one loop exact. In simple terms, the deep reason behind this is that the anomaly is a topological term (as we will see), which takes integer values, and thus, cannot vary continuously.\nThere is a deeper reason coming from supersymmetry and localization, but we can go down that avenue in the future.\nOnce we have the diagrams, it is a simple (tedious) exercise to calculate. One finds the total anomaly to be\n$$\\mathcal M^{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{e^2}{2\\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\alpha\\nu\\beta\\mu}k_{2\\alpha}k_{1\\beta}~. $$\nReattaching the photons,\n$$\\langle \\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu5} \\rangle = \\mathcal M^{\\mu\\nu} \\cdot \\frac12 A_\\mu(k_1) A_\\nu(k_2) = \\frac{-e^2}{16\\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma}F_{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\rho\\sigma} ~,$$ where in the last step, we went back to position space. It is now clear this is a topological term.\nTo preview what we will cover at a later date, one can follow Fujikawa\u0026rsquo;s method to derive the anomalies. Such method clearly shows that the anomaly (in the PI formalism) comes from the non-invariance of the PI measure under the symmetry and presents a clear connection with the geometric nature of the anomalies.\nThe integral over the anomaly gives the difference in the zero modes of different chiralities. Via Atiyah Singer, one can show this represents an integral of the relevant Chern character\n$$ \\nu_+ - \\nu_- = \\int_M dx \\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu5} = \\int_M \\text{ch}_2(F)~. $$ Further details can of course be found in Nakahara.\nNegative Magnetoresistance #\rWe have essentially found that\n$$ \\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu5} = \\frac{-e^2}{16\\pi^2} F_{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde F^{\\mu\\nu} ~.$$ If we rewrite this in terms of familiar 3-vector E\u0026amp;M, this is\n$$ \\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu5} = \\frac{-e^2}{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2 } \\vec E \\cdot \\vec B ~,$$ which tells us the divergence of the axial current (difference in the number of left and right handed particles) is not conserved.\nIn principle, this is observable, I can construct a parallel plate capacitor with a solenoid inside of it so the e field and b field go the same way.\nIf \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}^5 = 0\\), we literally get\n$$\\dot{Q}^5 = \\frac{-e^2}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^2}\\int d^3 x EB~.$$\nIndeed, related to the chiral anomaly, one can directly observe negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetals. Generically (in simple systems), the conductivity is inversely related to the magnetic field (See Ashcroft and Mermin), but In the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields though, there is a current of charge carriers which reduce the resistance. Incredibly, this effect was observed experimentally only around the mid 2010\u0026rsquo;s! The plot above is from this 2016 paper which worked with TaAs. You can see that the conductivity spikes when the fields are parallel.\nAgain, just to drive home how incredible this is, this comes from a one loop anomaly, a purely quantum effect that we can observe in a modest lab; without smashing two rocks into each other at high speeds).\nI should introduce a word of caution. I say \u0026ldquo;related to the chiral anomaly\u0026rdquo; because the condensed matter system is more complicated than the anomaly we just described. The crystal structure changes the space and one must be careful with the gauge fields and topology. Nonetheless, the phenomenon exhibits some characteristics we would expect from the anomaly.\n(\\(\\pi^0 \\to \\gamma\\gamma\\)) #\rWe \u0026ldquo;derived\u0026rdquo; the anomaly above for QED but generically, for some non-abelian symmetry generated by \\(T_A\\) and having \\(N\\) fermions\n$$J^{\\mu5}[T_A] = \\bar \\Psi \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^5 T_A \\Psi~,$$which should be taken as a matrix equation, we get\n$$\\partial \\cdot j^5[T_A] = \\frac{-g^2}{16\\pi^2}\\text{Tr~}( T_A \\epsilon^{abcd}F_{ab}F_{cd})~,$$ where the trace is over other quantum numbers.\nThe poster child of anomalies having observable consequences is \\(\\pi^0 \\to \\gamma\\gamma\\). In massless QCD for the quark doublet charged under electroweak, \\(Q\\) with \\(u,d\\) there is a \\(SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_V \\times U(1)_A \\). Ignoring the \\(U(1)\\)\u0026rsquo;s, we essentially have \\(SU(2)_V \\otimes SU(2)_A) with\n$$j^{\\mu5}[T^i] = \\bar Q \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^5 T^i Q~,$$ where the \\(T^i\\) are generators of \\(SU(2)\\). There is a possible contribution to the anomaly from the gluons which we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about as \\(\\text{Tr}~T^i \\lambda^a \\lambda^b =0\\) where \\(\\lambda\\) are \\(SU(3)\\) generators.\nThere is however, a contribution from QED. The relevant diagram is\nThe electric charge operator acts as \\(Q_e = T^3 + Y\\) where \\(Y\\) is the hypercharge. On the quarks, this gives (times e) \\(Q_e Q = \\text{diag}(\\frac 23,-\\frac 13)\\). The full anomaly is then\n$$\\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu5}[T^3] = \\frac{-1}{16\\pi^2}\\times 3\\times \\text{Tr~}(T^3 Q_e^2 \\epsilon^{abcd}F_{ab}F_{cd}) = \\frac{-1}{16\\pi^2}\\times 3 \\times \\frac{e^2}{6}(\\epsilon^{abcd}F_{ab}F_{cd})_{EM}~.$$ So how does this lead to the decay?\nLet us first note some things about the symmetry. The axial symmetry, if unbroken, would map a hadron to another hadron of the opposite chirality. No such thing exists in nature, so we have experimentally verified that this must be spontaneously broken. Indeed,\n$$SU(2)_V \\otimes SU(2)_A \\to SU(2)_V $$ as the quarks condense \\( \\langle \\bar Q Q \\rangle \\neq 0\\). The (psuedo-) goldstones that we get from this are the pions. If one writes down the most general EFT respecting this symmetry, it turns out to be the Effective Chiral lagrangian.\nTo get the connection to the pions with the current, we must invoke the PCAC hypothesis. Covering it would take (several) more posts so I will just say for more details, there is a wonderful chapter in Sydney Coleman\u0026rsquo;s notes section 41 or Peskin and Schroeder chapter 19.\nEssentially, the pions form an isospin triplet and have odd parities. Thus they can be created by the axial current. Then\n$$ \\langle 0| J^{\\mu 5a}(x) | \\pi^b(p) \\rangle = -i p^\\mu f_\\pi \\delta^{ab}e^{-ipx}~. $$ a,b are isospin indices and \\(f_\\pi=93 MeV\\) is the pion decay constant. Of course, one can then see that the divergence of the LHS will give a \\(p^2\\) on the RHS.\nWe can write\n$$J^{\\mu 5}[T^3] = -f_\\pi \\partial^\\mu \\pi^0 + \\text{multi-pions}~.$$ Taking the divergence (and putting mass back in)\n$$\\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu 5}[T^3] = -f_\\pi (\\partial^2 +m_\\pi^2) \\pi^0 + \\text{multi-pions}=\\frac{e^2}{32\\pi^2}(\\epsilon^{abcd}F_{ab}F_{cd})_{EM}.$$This is just the EOM for \\(\\pi^0\\). To get this, the effective lagrangian would need a term of the form\n$$ \\mathcal L \\supset \\sim \\frac{ e^2}{f_\\pi}\\pi^0 F \\wedge F. $$ Thus we see that there is a decay channel for the process in question. A direct computation of the scattering amplitude yields\n$$\\mathcal M(\\pi^0 \\to \\gamma \\gamma) = -8 \\frac{e^2}{32\\pi^2 f_\\pi}(\\epsilon^{abcd}(k_a e_b^*)_1(k_c e^*_d)_2~.$$\nOne can open up the PDG and find that this process occurs with branching 99%. The other 1% is largely \\(\\pi^0 \\to e^+ e^- \\gamma\\).\nChiral Anomalies (Baryon and Lepton) #\rThe standard model is a chiral theory. The left handed quarks and leptons are in the 2 of \\(SU(2)\\) while the right handed are singlets. For chiral theories,\n$$\\delta \\psi_L = i \\epsilon T_L \\psi_L~,\\quad \\delta \\psi_L = i \\epsilon T_R \\psi_R$$\nIn the same way as before (triangle diagrams), one finds generically for a non-abelian theory\n$$ \\partial \\cdot J^a = \\left(\\sum_{l} A(R_l) - \\sum_r A(R_r)\\right) \\frac{g^2}{128\\pi^2} d^{abc} \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta} F_{\\mu\\nu}^b F_{\\alpha\\beta}^c$$\nwhere the sum is over the left(right) handed Weyl fermions and \\(A(R_l)\\) is the anomaly coefficient under representation \\(R_l\\) (\\(A(R_r)\\) with \\(R_r\\)) and \\(d^{abc} = 2 \\text{Tr} T^a{T^b,T^c}\\).\nIn more concrete terms, with non-abelian generators \\(t^a = \\frac12 \\lambda^a\\), the anomaly is\n$$ \\partial \\cdot J = \\left(\\text{Tr}_{LHWF}(T_L t^a t^b) - \\text{Tr}_{RHWF}(T_R t^a t^b)\\right) \\frac{g^2}{32\\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta} F_{\\mu\\nu}^a F_{\\alpha\\beta}^b ~.$$\nIf there is an imbalance between the left and right charges, the current may be anomalous. This leads to interesting consequences.\nLepton and Baryon number anomaly #\rIf we look at \\(SU(2)\\) weak, we know the right handed quarks and leptons do not transform. Then the RHWF trace from above just gives 0. For any chiral symmetry,\n$$ \\partial \\cdot J^a = \\text{Tr}_{LH doublets}(T_L) \\frac{g_W^2}{64\\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta} F_{\\mu\\nu}^a F_{\\alpha\\beta}^b ~.$$The standard model has a \\(U(1)\\) lepton symmetry where leptons have charge +1 and quarks are uncharged. There are three doublets, \\((\\nu_e,e^-), (\\nu_\\mu, \\mu^-), (\\nu_\\tau,\\tau^-) \\) with +1 and 9 quark doublets with 0. Then\n$$ \\text{Tr}_{LHWF}(L) =3 \\times 1 + 9 \\times 0 = 3$$\nand therefore, lepton number is in fact anomalous.\nOne can play the same game for Baryon number. Quarks have 1/3 and leptons have 0.\n$$ \\text{Tr}_{LHWF}(B) =3 \\times 0 + 3 \\times 3 \\times \\frac13 = 3~.$$\nOne can calculate the net change in baryon or lepton number\n$$\\Delta = \\int d^4x \\partial \\cdot J[B,L] = 3 \\times I \\in 3 \\mathbb Z$$ \\(I\\) is the topological term from before that takes integer values. Here it has interpretation as an instanton which signals tunneling between different vacua. This essentially maps between different superselection sectors, adding or subtracting 3 baryons or leptons.\nPhysical Consequences #\rExperimentally, the \\(\\pm 3\\) B number would allow processes like $$\\text{deuteron} \\to \\text{antiproton + 3 positrons}$$b ut would be exponentially suppressed \\(\\sim 10^{-81}\\) so we will probably never see it in places like the LHC.\nIn general, writing terms that violate lepton or baryon number is useful. One can try $$ \\mathcal L_{SM} \\supset \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} \\ell \\ell H^\\dagger H^\\dagger $$ which would give neutrinos mass. Terms like \\( qqq\\ell, q \\bar{u^c} \\bar{d^c},q \\bar{u^c} \\bar{d^c}\\ell, u^c u^c d^c e^c \\) would allow for proton decay.\nNote that while B and L are anomalous, \\(B-L\\) is perfectly fine. It is very hard to write down terms that violate B or L separately while obeying B-L and they are usually very high dimension.\nIn principle B-L should also be broken somewhere along the way at high enough energies. There should be no global symmetries in quantum gravity. The situation above can be related to sphalerons in minkowski space. They could have been made in the early universe and allow for Leptogenesis to explain the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry we see IRL.\nGauge Anomalies #\rThe gauge anomalies actually take the same form as the Chiral anomalies. We would just take \\(T\\) to be a generator of the gauge group. There is one massive difference though: gauge symmetries aren\u0026rsquo;t really \u0026ldquo;symmetries\u0026rdquo;, they are redundancies of our description. It does not make sense for them to be anomalous. They usually lead to a breakdown in unitary.\nIf you find a gauge symmetry is anomalous, something has gone horribly, horribly, wrong. You are completely dead in the water (or SOL) and need to go back to the drawing board.\nThe beauty of the standard model #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s say I have been handed the entire standard model in all its chiral glory. I\u0026rsquo;ve been told that it has $$ SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_W \\times U(1)_Y $$and that the matter content has all kinds of charges. Some of the quarks and leptons are charged under electroweak, some aren\u0026rsquo;t. The hypercharge\u0026rsquo;s look weird, and there\u0026rsquo;s a Higgs floating around somewhere\u0026hellip;\nNaively it seems hopeless that this specific set matter transforms correctly enough in order to cancel all the gauge anomalies but if god is in his heaven the anomalies must cancel.\nAnd miraculously, it does! The standard model is completely free of anomalies! All of the gauge symmetries (all the triangle diagrams I can write down) are non-anomalous.\nIt is not just so simple as to the traces individually giving 0 (although this happens sometimes), the charges are set up in such a way that everything cancels non-trivially! The \\(u_R\\) quark doesn\u0026rsquo;t have hypercharge +4/3 because I want it to, it is because it has to be +4/3. And I can verify this experimentally.\nEven when I couple gravity and look at triangle diagrams with two gravitons, there is still no anomaly.\nThe standard model is absolutely beautiful. For matching with experiment and seeing all the specifies of matter and forces that we do, there is nothing else I could have written down.\nGreen and Schwarz #\rWhile the standard model is lovely, it is not UV complete (\\(U(1)_Y\\) has a Landau pole which kills the theory just below the Planck scale). It cannot answer questions about the early universe or black holes or deep quantum gravity questions. Not to mention, the Einstein Hilbert action is non-renormalizable.\nThis gives some inkling on the difficulty of building a consistent theory of quantum gravity which is good up to arbitrarily high energies. For the standard model, we put the matter and gauge fields in, then had to go back to make sure it wasn\u0026rsquo;t anomalous.\nFor a theory of quantum gravity, I have to worry about the gauge anomalies, and the anomalies that might come from diffeomorphism invariance. Gravity is after all, a type of gauge theory. The underlying physics should not depend on the coordinates I choose.\nBut I have no idea what the full spectrum of the theory is, I don\u0026rsquo;t know all the gauge group representations, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how they transform under gravity at all energy scales because I have no idea what quantum gravity looks like at high energies.\nThe situation is essentially hopeless. I have no idea where to even start.\nThis is what makes the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation in string theory such a big deal. It is a built in mechanism for canceling anomalies. By including the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory, one can exactly cancel the all of the anomalies that would have been present.\nInstead of trying to guess what the matter content is first and then praying for anomaly cancellation, I am handed a UV complete, anomaly free theory from the start with matter specified. Then I can try and drive down to the low energy limit and try to get the standard model and it is guaranteed to be consistent.\nThis is the calculation that launched the first superstring revolution.\nIn a follow up we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss anomaly polynomials, relations to topology, and anomaly descent.\n","date":"20 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/anomalies/pheno/","section":"Posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve recently gotten interested in anomalies for a variety of reasons and more specifically anomaly inflow, mostly due to an offshoot of a current project.","title":"Some phenomenology of anomalies","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rFunding Uncertainty #\rOver the past few months, the current government has taken a hammer to scientific funding in the form of several proposals to cut federal grants. This affects several areas, but especially academia.\nTo give an idea of how this usually works, someone will write a grant proposal in year 20XX and send it in to a government committee (for example, the NSF). Then the committee (composed of experts in the field) will take all the grant proposals they received and then rank them. The committee actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how many they will be able to fund until congress passes the budget for 20XX++. Once the committee knows how much money they have, they go down the list funding the proposals until they run out of money.\nFor example, lets say I get 3 proposals: States \\( \\ket \\psi\\) in quantum mechanics ($5), \\( \\mathcal N = 12\\) ) SUSY ($3), and Random walks in video game economies ($10)). I would rank these:\nRandom walks in video game economies \\( \\mathcal N = 12\\) SUSY in d=17 States \\( \\ket \\psi \\) in quantum mechanics. Then I learn that congress gives me a budget of $14. I can now fund the first two and have to pass on the third.\nAs you might imagine, during election years the process is a bit more volatile. Politics is inextricably linked with academia in this way. The people that are elected may support academia and science in general, or we could be in the current situation.\nAt the current moment, there is uncertainty on when (and which) federal grants will be disbursed (if at all) which affects both labs (resources to keep them running) and personnel (salaries, travel funding, graduate students, postdocs).\nPersonally, I know several people that have been hit by this, either by losing funding or are currently in danger of losing funding. This is also an especially difficult year for admissions into already selective graduate programs. With the uncertainty in funding, on top of the above potential funding cuts, many programs are vastly limiting the number of students they accept, letting none in at all, or even withdrawing offers that have already been given out. I know one person that this has happened to.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot to be said about the current political situation (including the situation on campuses and science in general) but instead, we\u0026rsquo;ll take just a small look at the justification behind this.\n\u0026ldquo;Woke DEI\u0026rdquo; #\rDEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility) is being targeted as a questionable motivation by the current administration and any program considering \u0026ldquo;DEI factors\u0026rdquo; is on the guillotine (See the official White House statement). This contributed to the NSF freezing the annual grant review. As of now, any proposal or program that had (or has) \u0026ldquo;DEI factors\u0026rdquo; has been red flagged. At UT specifically, we had a program that acted as a mini review course for incoming graduate students that got cut due to these orders as it was technically under the umbrella of \u0026ldquo;DEI\u0026rdquo;.\nPart of the justification of all this is an investigation led by Ted Cruz which claimed to identify 3,400 \u0026ldquo;woke DEI\u0026rdquo; grants or grants that \u0026ldquo;advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda\u0026rdquo; which had previously been funded. They graciously linked to the dataset \u0026ldquo;Public Database_Release (1) (1).xlsx\u0026rdquo;. Instead of doing one of several calculations my collaborators have been asking for, preparing for my qualifier, or doing any real work, I dusted python off to take a look at this data.\nSome basic facts:\nThere are 3,484 proposals totaling $4,117,435,830. Each is split into 4 categories for which it was flagged: \u0026ldquo;social justice\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;race\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;gender\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;environmental justice\u0026rdquo;. Note a single proposal can trigger more than one flag, or none at all. The split is: Social justice: 2585\nRace: 689\nGender: 1058\nEnvironmental justice: 362\nThe overlaps are plotted below (They may be easier to see in light mode): It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to note that, although one would expect there to be some correlation between the different categories (if one proposal supports race, they would also support gender), there is virtually no correlation between the categories. It seems like whoever made this list found the first thing that flags as DEI and just threw it into that bin. Of course, there are indeed math and physics proposals in this database, 152 total (which is a very small percentage of the total). Lets take a look at some of the advanced scientific research proposals advancing woke DEI and neo-Marxist warfare. Taken from here, I repeat the list and add some others: Social Justice Category\nElliptic and parabolic partial differential equations Isoperimetric and minkowski problems in convex geometric analysis Stability patterns in the homology of moduli spaces Stable homotopy theory in algebra, topology, and geometry Log-concave inequalities in combinatorics and order theory Harmonic analysis, ergodic theory and convex geometry Learning graphical models for nonstationary time series Statistical methods for response process data Homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory Groups acting on combinatorial objects Low dimensional topology via Floer theory Uncertainty quantification for quantum computing algorithms From equivariant chromatic homotopy theory to phases of matter: Voyage to the edge Field theories and holography Gender Category\nGeometric aspects of isoperimetric and sobolev-type inequalities Link homology theories and other quantum invariants Commutative algebra in algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics Moduli spaces and vector bundles Numerical analysis for meshfree and particle methods via nonlocal models Development of an efficient, parameter uniform and robust fluid solver in porous media with complex geometries Computations in classical and motivic stable homotopy theory Analysis and control in multi-scale interface coupling between deformable porous media and lumped hydraulic circuits Four-manifolds and categorification Scattering in quantum gravity: symmetries and holography Theoretical and numerical investigation of symmetric mass generation Race Category\nStability patterns in the homology of moduli spaces Precision measurement of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor anti-neutrinos None Theoretical particle physics and cosmology at UC Irving Emergent quantum phenomena in epitaxial thin films of topological Dirac semimetal and its heterostructures Indeed, it is clear that items like \u0026ldquo;homotopy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;homology\u0026rdquo; are clearly just woke DEI initiatives.\nIn fact several of these proposals just have \u0026ldquo;DEI\u0026rdquo; keywords included in their proposals. Including the prior, we have \u0026ldquo;inclusion maps, representations, inequalities,\u0026rdquo; and a host more. Of the 152, there were 49 (~30%) that had \u0026ldquo;DEI\u0026rdquo; keywords like the one above within the first few words.\nSome facts about this subset:\nThe split is:\nSocial justice: 116\nRace: 17\nGender: 74\nEnvironmental justice: 3 (So apparently, the physical sciences really don\u0026rsquo;t care about the environment.)\nIn all these cost $38,648,187 which is 0.93 % of the total cost.\nThe distribution with respect to the other data is given here (note both axis are log):\nWhile its nice to get some gallows humor out of DEI terms in math and physics, realistically, most of these grants were chosen due to some part of them dedicating money to allow access to those that may not have the resources to learning the material. For example, a workshops on the topic that ensures underrepresented individuals have the opportunity to attend.\nThese have been the default in grant proposals and generally included under \u0026ldquo;broader impacts\u0026rdquo; where the proposal would outline how their work would benefit society outside the field. Now, these proposals need to be either reworded or these parts must be left out.\nAll in all, academia is in a weird state right now with respect to politics. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens going forward.\n","date":"16 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/physics_life/dei/","section":"Posts","summary":"Funding Uncertainty #\rOver the past few months, the current government has taken a hammer to scientific funding in the form of several proposals to cut federal grants.","title":"Homology is DEI?","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rI\u0026rsquo;ve just gotten back from Aspen\u0026rsquo;s workshop on observables in quantum gravity where the main goal was to have experimentalists and theorist come together to talk about what could be observed in quantum gravity and how the experimentalists could actually go into the lab and observe it.\nOn the theory end #\rFrom the theorists, the primary focus was on the algebra of observables which has gotten popular over recent years. There were really two camps on this front (though they frequently interacted with each other and are closely related).\nOne camp was trying to detail the emergence of space time holographically and study the limits of large N theories to say something concrete about emergent geometry. The other camp wanted to understand the role of the observer better and the structure of the crossed product algebra. Included on this end is how to construct diffeomorphism invariant observables and what it means to do so.\nOne might ask what the point of these von Neumann algebras are and I think Elliot Gesteau put it in a great way. Broadly in math, there are two fields: algebra and analysis. In algebra we find the science of structures (lie algebras, groups, etc.) and in analysis, we find the science of limits (calculus, functional analysis, etc.). Von Neumann algebras are of course under the domain of analysis.\nTo put it another way, if you want to understand the structure of a theory, look at the groups, the representations, and look at particles, von Neumann algebras are really not the right framework to use. Instead, von Neumann algebras are useful for understanding limits of theories and their constituents. This is what makes it a natural venue to talk about subregions. Therefore it is natural that it is useful for trying to describe observables for local theories or the emergence of spacetime for large N theories.\nThere was a significant amount of progress during this conference. It was incredible to have almost everyone that works on the topic in the same place for once (the first time this has happened I believe) and it was wonderful to bounce ideas off of each other and pave a path forward. For the first party above, the task seemed to be to analyze what the consequences of large N theories are for the emergence of spacetime, what the corrections mean, and whether one can make sense of spacetime at large but finite N (and its consequences for current and previous results *cough* no global symmetries *cough* ). On the latter party\u0026rsquo;s end, what exactly should the observables be invariant other? Should they include the large diffeos as well? What does the soft structure look like and what role do they play for the algebra? Exactly when can we introduce this \u0026ldquo;observer degree of freedom\u0026rdquo; \\(L^2(\\mathbb R)\\) and do we need the crossed product to do this, or is there an alternative way? Is there a top down was to construct and \u0026ldquo;course grain\u0026rdquo; the necessary quantities to get current answers?\nOn the experiment end #\rThe conference title has both \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;experiment\u0026rdquo; in the title, so roughly half the talks were experiment. This camp too, was split into two. One camp that wanted to understand quantum gravity by simulating it on a quantum computer or many body system and then invoking holography to make some statements. Primarily the theoretical tool of choice for this endeavor seems to be the SYK model which is dual to JT gravity. They seems to be making good headway and are looking for good observables to test (in the sense that they are interesting, yet reasonable to measure within the next few years and a lab). I have my own thoughts of this approach but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it to next time.\nThe second camp is not so much trying to study a theory of quantum gravity, but to just verify gravity is quantum in the first place. One proposal is to do this by entangling a macroscopic(ish) particle with some other masses such that space itself is in a superposition. The argument seems to be the scale at which we can measure gravitational effects is getting smaller and smaller every year, while the size of objects we can entangle is getting bigger and bigger. At some point these seem like they will meet.\nAnother proposal, (that I am a bit more skeptical of) says that they will create a causal diamond and with lasers and then measure the fluctuations of the size. The argument given was that they can use the area operator to measure the size, but the derivation was lackluster at best. This operator takes one out of the Hilbert space as it has infinite norm wrt any state. The claim during the talks was that it could be regulated, but this was confusing to me as I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand what exactly they were regulating wrt. The end result gave an expression that suggested a sufficiently big causal diamond could have its area variation measured but the derivation seemed sketchy at best. The allusions to flat holography really didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense and I don\u0026rsquo;t think can be trusted.\nOnly when I talked to Temple He at dinner did he tell me they were regulating wrt the size of the causal diamond itself. This makes a bit more sense, but I still think in order to measure any variation of the causal diamond size, it would be much larger than what one could construct on earth.\nI also had the chance to talk to Markus Aspelmeye who told me about his experiment to probe gravity at the 10 micron scale. For him, it was just something he wanted to do for the sake of doing it, but when Vafa realized this would be within reach of the Dark dimension/swampland predictions for extra dimensions, he got extremely involved (to the point where he is apparently making suggestions to the experiment).\nAs a side note, during Dan Carney\u0026rsquo;s public talk, someone asked, \u0026ldquo;I think physics made a wrong turn when it decided to discard aether, what do you have to say about that?\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen someone try and swallow a frog, but I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that\u0026rsquo;s the expression he made.\nTLDR #\rThe theorist mainly discussed von Neumann algebras (emergent spacetime and/or dressed observables), while the experimentalists focused trying to show gravity is quantum in the first place and many-body/quantum computing realizations of theories with a gravity dual.\nAll in all, I met some great people there, learned a lot, got some ideas for new projects, and confirmation that some of my other ideas weren\u0026rsquo;t completely idiotic.\n","date":"17 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/conference/aspen2025/","section":"Posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve just gotten back from Aspen\u0026rsquo;s workshop on observables in quantum gravity where the main goal was to have experimentalists and theorist come together to talk about what could be observed in quantum gravity and how the experimentalists could actually go into the lab and observe it.","title":"Aspen 2025: Observables in QG","type":"posts"},{"content":"Recently an external review committee (ERC) has commented on the state of the department and proposed possible solutions, or at least places where the department should look into. They discussed with current graduate students as well as faculty to come to some conclusions. Some of these points I agree with, some I am vehemently against.\nPay #\rTo get the obvious out of the way, the ERC found the students should be paid more. Compared to other similar institutions, we are underpaid by roughly $5000. This is terrible, even before considering the other institutions we were compared to are located in lower cost of living areas than Austin.\nMore fellowships would be more appreciated, but a blanket raise seems to be much more useful. The ERC floated the idea of \u0026ldquo;starting a revenue-generating professional Master program\u0026rdquo; to provide more funds. This seems, to my inexperienced eyes, a distasteful thing to do. I am not sure how much value one gets from a \u0026ldquo;professional Masters\u0026rdquo; in physics, nor do I know how much this would contribute positively to our department beyond bringing in funds.\nThe Building #\rThe physics building (PMA) is perhaps the most unattractive part of this department. The ERC rightfully identifies this as a major issue. Even ignoring the terrible façade, the building itself seems to be outright hostile to the act of doing physics.\nThe different departments, even those who may work together, are outright segregated onto different floors. Even within those floors, there are not meaningful areas to run into and spontaneously start discussions. Ideally, this would be a place that was central and where one must pass by on their way to the office. These spontaneous discussions are often where one can informally toss ideas back and forth in a way that is impossible in a classroom or a scheduled meeting.\n(Indeed, this is how I was introduced to the gravitational algebras in the first place, I went to go make coffee and started up a conversation with a colleague on what he had been working on. Neither he nor I particularly knew about the algebras, but after bouncing ideas off of one another, we agreed it would be worthwhile to look at.)\nThe solution to this is a new building, one conducive to interactions through plenty of common space and less segregated. From a theorists perspective, the point going into work is to interact with others, else in this day and age, we could just work on scratch paper at home (also the reason why I find coming to campus and then keeping your door closed 90% of the time preposterous).\nIt would be nice to have a building specifically for the Weinberg institute (hopefully with windows in the grad student offices).\nAs a band-aid fix, the ERC proposed converting the 4th (ground) floor library to an area for interaction. They specified \u0026ldquo;other departments have in this age of electronic access to journals and books\u0026rdquo; so I assume they mean to remove the books from the library. This is a terrible idea.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good that there are resources available online, but getting rid of books serves no one. Libraries provide an easy means to access information that may otherwise be inaccessible. Beyond the preference of having a physical copy of a book, to gain access to a book, I don\u0026rsquo;t need anything else. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to have an ipad, laptop, phone, etc. If tomorrow my backpack gets stolen with all my electronics inside, I can still come into work the next day and not be hindered due to the reference books in my office.\nAdditionally, the building spans 17 floors. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect anyone to take a trip all the way down to the 4th floor to just have a casual conversation. It is not conducive to the spontaneous discussions I mentioned above. To me, converting the 4th floor library seems to have almost only downsides.\nI am not sure what a good short term solution would be.\nCourses #\rThe ERC\u0026rsquo;s perspective on courses is one place where I have no complaints. To summarize, 4, not just 2 courses should be allowed to be tested out of. The experimental course, while important, should be more encompassing on what counts as \u0026ldquo;experimental\u0026rdquo;. Right now, it seems to be mainly hands on work which would disqualify most of the high energy experimentalists.\nThe coursework itself seems to have a heavy workload, though in my experience, this depends on the professor. From what I saw of my friends taking statistical mechanics, the load seemed to be unnecessarily dense, though Aaron Zimmerman\u0026rsquo;s course on classical mechanics was a good blend of what should necessarily be covered without going into unessacary tedious calculations. Vadim Kaplunovsky\u0026rsquo;s courses (which I actually took) were difficult, but there were usually clever ways of solving the problems such that the workload was light if you knew what you were doing.\nOverall, the ERC agreed the structure of the courses, along with how the students are advised to take them, contributed to extending how long it took to get the degree.\nThey also noted more advanced courses are needed, which I agree with, though I am saddened that this means less HET courses (we lost string theory II).\nPerception #\rThe ERC notes that compared to similar universities, UT attracts almost half the applicants that they do. Some easy factors to blame are the pay and the building (as mentioned above). The ERC claims the long time till graduation due to course structure is also to blame, though anecdotally, I, nor anyone I knew cared about this metric when applying to grad schools (at least, it was not the 1st to n-1\u0026rsquo;th concern).\nThey only mention in one line that the issue may be due to being located in Texas itself. Location-wise, there are not many university\u0026rsquo;s close enough to facilitate continuous interactions. The closest to UT would be Texas A\u0026amp;M, and even that is more than an hour drive away. Even then, there aren\u0026rsquo;t many interactions with TAMU to begin with. Compared to universities on the east or west coast that have universities close enough to each other such that scientists can just pop in and out, UT is at a disadvantage. (As another anecdote, the journey between Osaka University and the Yukawa institute is comparable, and there were monthly extraditions where one HET group would go to the others school to just discuss what they were working on and have dinner. Personally I traveled to Kyoto for daytrips quite often to discuss. It was easy to hop on a train and read a paper, especially for ~$4 USD.)\nOf course, politics is another issue. Without going into the details, I do not think it is any secret that due to the political tendencies of the current government, there are good graduate students that refuse to apply. This also affects potential faculty. From talking to postdocs who are looking for tenure track jobs, a non-insignificant number of them refuse to come to Texas for the same reason.\nThese are just some quick thoughts on the review, many of which I\u0026rsquo;ve expressed in person, but it is nice to have them all in one place. I\u0026rsquo;ve missed many other things, but this is good enough for now.\nTLDR: #\rStudents are payed ~$5k less than similar universities. The building lacks common spaces, is unattractive, and is not conducive to spontaneous discussions. Converting the 4th floor library is a bad idea for a myriad of reasons. The courses are structured too rigidly. Negative perception (leading to less applicants and pulling less faculty) of UT may be due to the pay, building, and location.

Usually though, we don\u0026rsquo;t do string theory on this geometry because to support the spacetime, we need the RR fields (\\(p\\)-branes naturally couple to \\(p+1\\) forms). Instead, we go to the SUGRA picture where we can just deal with the fields, and in some cases, can just do the classical gravity calculation.\nBut this isn\u0026rsquo;t technically string theory. Actual string theory on curved backgrounds is still woefully understood (barring one set of systems). It was bothersome to me that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know exactly how the RR fields make computations difficult (most papers just say they are), so I took it upon myself to go through the literature and find out.\nAfter some review of strings on curved spacetimes, we primarily follow Berenstein and Leigh and Polyakov. By no means is this meant to be exhaustive, but it should at least tell you what to look for.\nStrings on a curved background #\rBefore continuing, it is worth reviewing how strings look on curved backgrounds. We\u0026rsquo;ll just follow Polchinski. The natural thing to do on the worldsheet, is just promote the flat metric to a curved metric \\(\\eta \\to G\\), such that the worldsheet action is $$S_\\sigma = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\alpha\u0026rsquo;}\\int_M d^2 \\sigma \\sqrt{g} g^{ab} G_{\\mu\\nu}(X) \\partial_aX^\\mu \\partial_bX^\\nu ,$$ where due to the metric dependence on \\(X\\), the action this that if a non-linear sigma model. But because the curved background should be a state of string theory, this change doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem stringy enough.\nTo justify this, we write \\(G = \\eta + \\chi (X)\\) and place in into the path integral. Then the integrand is just $$e^{-S_p} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\alpha\u0026rsquo;}\\int_M d^2 \\sigma \\sqrt{g} g^{ab} \\chi_{\\mu\\nu}(X) \\partial_aX^\\mu \\partial_bX^\\nu + \\dots\\right) ,$$ where \\(S_p\\) is just the free Polyakov action and the \\(\\dots\\) are higher order terms. But the second term in parenthesis is indeed just the graviton vertex operator. In all, the integrand will look like $$e^{-S_p}(1 + VO + \\frac12 VO^2 + \\frac16 VO^3 + \\dots) = e^{-S_p}e^{VO} .$$\nSo we see that the sigma model, an interacting 2d CFT, is just the same working with the free CFT and including the exponentiated vertex operators into the path integral. Equivalently, if I want to compute an amplitude, I can still use the free propagators, I just need to include the exponentiated VOs in the correlator.\nThis is hard. I can try to do things order by order, but a naive approach is difficult as I would need to compute an infinite number of correlators with the VOs, and the wick contractions get more or more complicated. Still, there is hope, but we\u0026rsquo;ll find the RR fields will dash it.\nWhy RR fields are difficult #\rRemember (from Polchinski v2) that the Ramond VOs generally look like $$\\mathscr{V} = e^{-\\phi/2} \\Theta(z)$$ where \\(\\phi(z)\\) are free fields that appear in the bosonization of NSR superconformal \\(\\beta,\\gamma\\) ghosts and \\(\\Theta\\) is a spin field. Note that a difficulty with spin fields is they have branch cuts at operators. VOs are generally labeled by their \\(\\phi\\) (and \\(\\tilde{\\phi}\\) ) charges. The R VO above has charge \\((-1/2,0)\\), or is in the \\((-1/2,0)\\) picture. In general, we say an operator is in the \\((q,\\tilde{q})\\) picture.\nOur earlier prescription would have us stick these spin fields into the worldsheet lagrangian which leads to unclear formulas at the very least. Worse, it destroys the superconformal invariance of the worldsheet that is the main motive behind the NSR formalism. Instead, we can try to include them into the amplitudes as VOs.\nAlso note we will be needing picture changing operators (PCOs) to insert into the amplitudes as to prevent anomalies, the amplitude vanishing, or diverging. In general, the total number of PCOs should be, on a surface of genus \\(g\\), $$n_X=2g-2 + n_B + n_F/2,$$ where \\(n_B,n_F\\) are the number of bosonic and fermionic operators respectively. Remember that on the curved background, we need to exponentiate these VOs, which means we need to include a different number of PCOs at all levels. In addition, to compute amplitudes to arbitrarily high genus, we have to integrate the VOs and the PCOs over Super Riemann surfaces, which is not an easy task (remember the RR VOs get branch cuts when they hit another operator). There are some tricks one can play and a good resource is Witten\u0026rsquo;s perturbative superstring theory revisited.\nThe need for the RR fields #\rIf we stack \\(N\\) D3-branes, we automatically have contributions to the RR sector to the 4 form potential \\(C_4\\) with total unit flux \\(N\\) as \\(N = \\int_{S^5} F_5 \\). This calculation was done by Polchinski by computing tadpoles of the graviton and RR 4-form potential with branes. By the same calculation, by scattering gravitons off of the D-brane, we find the metric to be\n$$g_{\\mu \\nu}(X) = \\tilde{G}(X)(\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}^\\perp - \\delta_{\\mu\\nu}^{||}),$$ where \\(\\tilde{G}(X) = \\frac{R^4}{2r^4}\\), and \\(R\\) is the AdS radius. Note the manifest \\(SO(1,3) \\times SO(6)\\) symmetry.\nIn the (-1/2,-1/2) picture, the RR vertex operator (for the 5 form) takes the form\n$$\\mathscr{V}_{RR} = e^{-\\phi/2} e^{-\\tilde{\\phi}/2} \\Sigma^\\alpha \\bar{\\Sigma}^\\beta \\Gamma^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_5}_{\\alpha\\beta} F_{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_5}$$ where the \\(\\Sigma\\)\u0026rsquo;s are spin fields. Note that\n$$\\Gamma^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_5}_{\\alpha\\beta} F_{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_5} = \\Gamma_{||}\\Gamma^\\alpha \\partial_\\alpha G(X).$$\nBecause the RR fields are directly supporting the \\(AdS_5 \\times S^5\\) geometry, we have no choice but to include them. Another way to see this is to just write down the stress energy solution in the GS formalism, then translate over to NSR. It is given by\n$$T_{zzNSR} = \\frac12 \\partial X^m \\partial X_m + \\frac12 : (\\Gamma + \\Gamma\\Gamma) \\psi^m \\partial \\psi_m: + \\epsilon^{p_1\\dots p_4} [e^\\phi \\psi_{p_1}\\psi_{p_2}\\psi_{p_3}\\psi_{p_4}\\psi_{p_t}\\partial y^t + \\partial(e^\\phi \\psi_{p_1}\\psi_{p_2}\\psi_{p_3}) \\partial\\tilde{x}_{p_4}] + ghosts]$$ where \\(\\Gamma\\) is the PCO, t runs from 4 to 9, p from 0 to 3, and m from 0 to 9. Actually, up to the PCOs, the stress energy tensor is exactly the same as that of flat space with no branes. Therefore, the PCO term is directly due to the RR fluxes. The way to see this is nontrivial. If a RR vertex is placed on a vertex and a boundary is present, the holomorphic and anti-holomorphics ghost and spin operators are no longer independent, but related to each other. This also occurs with the GS string for the fermionic variable \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\bar \\theta \\) when we included the D3-branes. Thus, without the D3-branes, there would be no relation between the holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts, and the 5 form and 3 form terms in the stress energy tensor would vanish.\nAlternatively, it is much much easier to see this from IIB SUGRA. Including the D3-branes and solving Einstein\u0026rsquo;s equations give us the 5-form on the RHS sourcing the AdS geometry.\nIn anycase, we now need to include these VOs into the action or exponentiate and throw in a correlator. This is hard in itself, but one could theoretically go order by order. It is not fun. You can see the last part of Polyakov\u0026rsquo;s paper above to get a taste of it. At the end, GS formalism will start to look appetizing.\nSo what now? #\rThis unfortunately puts a damper on doing string theory on \\(AdS_5 \\times S^5\\), so what should we do now?\nWell, if we still really want to work with the D3 branes, we can work in the GS formalism (or the Hybrid formalism). The calculations (outside of a few nice gauges) are rather difficult, but we don\u0026rsquo;t run into this issue with the RR fields. Alternatively, we could just try to deal with it and go order by order to learn something, or maybe try and figure out a nice way to deal with the PCOs or the super Riemann surfaces.\nThere is a place where we get around this issue with the RR fluxes though, and can do actual string theory. These are \\(AdS_3 \\times \\mathcal{M}\\) solutions. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of power here with sigma models being controllable due to having a nice target space, U-duality, or setups that don\u0026rsquo;t need RR fluxes. For instance, for \\(\\mathcal M = S^3 \\times \\mathcal X_4\\), the geometry can be supported by NSNS 2 forms (the setup being F1 and NS5 branes).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve recently been quite interested in the \\(AdS_3 \\times S^3 \\times T^4\\) setup as it seems like there are still several open questions. Namely, the relation between IIB string theories and an apparent relation to a grand canonical ensemble of free symmetric orbifold CFTs. The relation between this and ensemble averaging is also interesting. Generally, a set of central charge \\(c\\) CFTs are averaged in these lower dimensions to give a gravitational theory (really just an effective one). Additionally, we already know that incorporating the other compact dimensions leads to novel solutions, but it would be exciting to see the stringy side of these things. Additionally, it would be interesting to see how the SCFT\u0026rsquo;s decoupled 4-torus sector shows up in the string theory.\n","date":"21 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/string-theory/ads5rr/","section":"Posts","summary":"Not a lot of string theory in AdS/CFT #\rIn the most well understood version of AdS/CFT, we stack N D3-branes and then see that the near horizon geometry is \\(AdS_5 \\times S^5\\).","title":"Doing actual string theory in AdS/CFT","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rUnnecessary Intro #\rAlmost everyday, usually in the afternoon, either back at home or in the office, I make an iced pour over.

Before what I know becomes too outdated, I\u0026rsquo;d like to detail my experience doing research on AI, some general thoughts and criticisms on where AI research is now, and why I decided to (for the most part) leave the field.\nOf course, one should take this entire manuscript with a heavy pinch of salt. Competent individuals should almost always take care to not place much weight on people that speak outside of their fields. Much of what will be said here is opinion, and the scientific remarks may or may not be right (or simply just outdated). I am more than happy to be corrected in discussions.\nAs the manuscript was getting a bit long, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to split this into two parts, with the first being more my personal experience, and the second being some criticisms and opinions.\nIntroduction #\rI should take some time to set up my (few) credentials and some context. I completed my CS degree at Texas A\u0026amp;M In the Fall of 2022. Up to this point, I was decently involved and kept up with AI research. I was mainly doing work on Reinforcement Learning (RL) under Yoonsuck Choe; an excellent AI researcher mainly working on AI in the way I envisioned one should be doing it, really studying the inner workings of AI through the lens of neuroscience (as opposed to adding 47 more layers to a neural network (NN), spending millions training it, then declaring success).\nTo summarize the last part of the title, here are the bullet points of what led me to leave computer science:\nI simply liked physics more and thought there were deeper, more crucial questions to ask in this field. I did not like the direction AI was going when I was finishing up my degree. It turns out, after three years of suffering through a CS degree, I really, really hate coding. While I was rather confident that I wanted to continue on in physics in grad school, what really cemented this in my brain was an interaction in my AI class. I remember a guest lecturer stood at the podium, asked if anyone here was a physicist, and when I raised my hand, looked into my eyes and said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to say this, but physics is a dead field, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing more to discover. All future interesting discoveries will be in the field of artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo;. This statement was so preposterous I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the words to reply. Off the top of my head, I could list off a dozen open issue that would have massive implications for our understanding of the universe or technologies.\nAt this point I realized that, although AI research was were interesting (and profitable), my heart was really with physics.\nLastly, I never really had the patience for coding. Especially with regards to AI, it always felt like an obstacle to getting the results that I wanted; however, CS is much more than coding, and this point I will save for last.\nMy Work #\rHere I\u0026rsquo;ll detail exactly what I did for research, some good points, and some points where I really dropped the ball. To start off, I need to describe reinforcement learning (RL).\nIn my opinion, RL is probably the most robust form of AI and the most likely to provide insight into intelligence or sentience. It lends itself to experiments and playgrounds very naturally. You can use the framework in real world simulations, video games, or interactions.\nAs opposed to setups where the problem is a black box:\nGive the NN an image and it tells us if it is a cat or dog (say YOLO), Given a word, predict the next word (say chat-gpt), the setup for RL has an agent living in an environment. The agent can act on the environment, and in response, the environment can act on the agent.\nQuick Intro to RL #\rI worked in the subfield of AI called RL. Really I should talk about Markov Decision Processes, but that is too much depth. All you need to know is that the setup consists of an environment \\(\\mathcal E\\), an agent that can do some action \\(\\mathcal A\\), and a reward \\(\\mathcal R\\) that the environment gives the agent depending on whether the agent did something desirable. The canonical example is cartpole (which my friend did an intro to here). Essentially, the setup is a cart that is trying to balance a pole. When the cart moves to the left or right (does \\(\\mathcal A\\) ), \\(\\mathcal E\\) sees whether the pole is still balanced or not and gives the agent \\(\\mathcal R\\) accordingly. Intrinsic Motivation #\rNote that in the previous example, \\(\\mathcal E\\) was responsible for giving a reward. There are also systems where instead of the environment giving the reward, the agent draws a reward from themselves without regards to the the environment. This is called intrinsic motivation. For example, curiosity $$ \\mathcal R = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\mathcal A \\text{ has already been done before} \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; \\mathcal A \\text{ has never been done before} \\ \\end{cases} $$ where the agent gets a reward if it does something novel. An interesting exhibition of this can be found here, where a group of researcher using intrinsic motivation to train Mario.\nDetails can be found in my thesis where I tried to study intrinsic motivation and tried to disentangle intrinsic motivation from extrinsic motivation (actions taken due to feedback from \\(\\mathcal E\\) ). I essentially found that spikes in improvement of the agent were correlated (or sometimes even preceded) by spike in intrinsic motivation.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll save you the trouble of opening the link, I truly think this is a terrible thesis.\nThe Bad #\rI wanted to propose a metric for intrinsic motivation using information theory, but the \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo; is mathematically not even a metric. The environments were too simple: even if the \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo; had worked, the agents did not display complex enough behavior to where one could meaningfully, experimentally, seen a big difference I did not do my diligence for literature review. While not studied explicitly in the context of intrinsic motivation, studies of AI with information theory are certainly not new. I did not take a careful look at these. I spent way too much time trying to think of a theoretical framework in which to work in instead of just coding agents and studying information theoretic quantities of these agents. I was much too focused on developing a whole \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; when I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have any experiments to base my theory off of. In physics, we at least have sacred concepts like like symmetries and unitarity to keep us from writing down anything. For what I was doing, I either did not have these, or didn\u0026rsquo;t know I had these.\nIn short, I was too ambitious and really didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThe Good #\rDespite these short comings, there are a few points in this thesis that are morally interesting.\nThe idea to describe intrinsic motivation with information theoretic is not a bad one. Instead of jumping straight to trying to define a \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo;, it is interesting enough (and I should have) to consider entropies of the agent, environment, and rewards as the system evolves, or the mutual information between them.\nThis is the direction my advisor was pushing me towards. Take different agents and environments and just ask what the info quantities look like. Whether by arrogance, or laziness to avoid coding more, I decided to ignore this advice. If I could go back, this is the main thing I would change, and leave finding a \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo; to some future goal.\nThe model was small enough to where internal dynamics of the agent could studied. It is said that AI are black boxes to which their inner workings cannot be explained. This is virtually true. Todays powerful AI models are so big that trying to describe their internal dynamics is almost impossible. They are, for all intents and purposes, black boxes that we just hit run on and pray work.\nI chose rather small agents (In terms of size of NNs) to work with such that I could describe the aforementioned quantities explicitly. While I don\u0026rsquo;t think the approach is new, exploring the internal dynamics of an agent to fully grasp what the (to borrow a phrase from physics) \u0026ldquo;moduli space\u0026rdquo; is, is interesting.\nTo say a major point in short, it taught me (in hindsight somewhat) several points on how to do/not do research, what questions were good to ask, and how to break a problem into smaller problems. It was also one of the first forays I had into the difficulties of getting funding and how difficult it was to train AI models on expensive hardware.\nPart 2 #\rIn the next section, I have some more general thoughts on AI, criticisms, and CS in general.\n","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/compsci/ai-pt1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Abstract #\rAs some may know, I completed an undergraduate degree in computer science, primarily focusing on AI and reinforcement learning.","title":"AI, research, computer science pt. 1","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/artificial-intelligence/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Artificial-Intelligence","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/literature/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Literature","type":"tags"},{"content":"これまで私にとっては、よく難解ことであるが、色々な古典小説を読もうとしている。最近、参考までに、住野よるの「また、同じ夢を見ていた」を読んでいた。主人公が小学生ので、「このキャラの言葉や考え方は分かることがかんたんはずでしょう」と思えた。たしかに、間違ていなかったけど、「かんたん」というより、「モダン」というもっと正解です。この時、やっと気づきました。夏目漱石や太宰治の本の文体は素敵ですけど、日常会話のために（とくにカジュアル会話）あまり便利じゃない。\n読書のために読むことが好きである反面、読書練習のためにも必要がある。なかでも、人間は色々ことを読むことによって勉強しないといけない。だから、古典小説を読んで勉強しようとすると、問題は起こるかもしれない。たとえば、もしかして、チャールズ・ディケンズの本からキャラのように話すことアリスに会ったら、「ちょっと変な人か本当に文学が好きな人か」と思うかもしれない。同様にもし私は侍のように「でござる」と言うことを始めたら、他の人はちょっとびっくりしたかもしれない。\n実は、たくさん有名な日本人の作家は1900年ぐらい（+/-何十年か）へ書いたので、チャールズ・ディケンズの文体と比較するよりもジョン・スタインベックの文体と比較したほうがいい。とにかく、これはあまり問題じゃない。もし私はアリスに突き当たら、「立派な人みたい」と思えつもりです。\nこのポストは私にとってもっと現代小説が読むべきサインだ。村上の「ノルウェイの森」が楽しそう。たぶん、もっと新しい本を読みたい。もしおすすめがあったら、教えてください。\nもちろん、私の下手な日本語を許してほしい。\n","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/nihongo/hontachi/","section":"Posts","summary":"これまで私にとっては、よく難解ことであるが、色々な古典小説を読もうとしている。最近、参考までに、住野よるの「また、同じ夢を見ていた」を読んでいた。主人公が小学生ので、「このキャラの言葉や考え方は分かることがかんたんはずでしょう」と思えた。たしかに、間違ていなかったけど、「かんたん」というより、「モダン」というもっと正解です。この時、やっと気づきました。夏目漱石や太宰治の本の文体は素敵ですけど、日常会話のために（とくにカジュアル会話）あまり便利じゃない。","title":"古典と現代小説を読むことの感想","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"日本語","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rEvery now and then, one pursues an idea thinking it could lead to something interesting, but then soon finds a dead end. Despite this, there may be one or two concepts that are interesting to talk about, yet not worthy of publication. While searching for Carroll SCFT, symmetries and unitarity bounds seem to suggest 7d SCFTs exist if they are Carroll.\nNaïve Unraveling of \\(AdS_5 \\times S^5 \\) #\rOne goal of the flat holography program is to obtain an S-matrix for flat space holographically. As Polchinski has shown, a way that one could do this is to take the limit $$R \\rightarrow \\infty$$ where \\(R\\) is the radius of AdS. There are some stringent consistency conditions that make this much harder than expected. Recently it has been shown by taking Carroll limits of Witten diagrams, one is able to obtain amplitudes that make sense. Nevertheless, these programs (celestial holography included) really only talk about the boundary theory and bulk kinematically. What one really wants is a \u0026ldquo;dictionary\u0026rdquo; analogous to AdS/CFT.\nIdeally, one would figure out a boundary theory that immediately reproduces string amplitudes ( \\(g_s\\) should be finite) in the bulk with its CFT correlators. Carroll CFTs seem to have the correct symmetry group for this. One may want to say $$\\text{Carroll SYM } \\sim \\text{IIB string theory in flat}$$ and this does seem to be the most promising take.\nFor now, a naïve (top down) approach may be to unravel the 10d AdS spacetime with compact dimensions but there immediately seems to be problems with this. In addition to difficulties in specifying the asymptotic states (see Polchinski), the AdS radius is the same as the sphere radius, the naïve limit would give $$AdS_5\\times S^5 \\rightarrow \\mathbf R^{1,9}.$$ So what seems to be the problem? If I believe in holography,. I should have a 9d theory living at null infinity, right?\nWell, some questions immediately come up. What happens to the R-charges? In the well understood description, the \\(SU(4) \\sim SO(6)\\) R-symmetry is identified with the \\(S^5\\) isometry. Something is going on here and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like the naïve approach is the one to take.\n9d (probably) does not work #\rSome might be screaming an obvious fact at this point. If you have passed 5th grade, you know SCFTs do not exist past 6d. This stems from Nahm and Minwalla and is easy to see from unitarity and symmetry arguments. In the graded Lie superconformal algebra, the even part (with SO(d+2)) needs to be represented spinorially on the odd part. This exists up to SO(8) where the vector and spinor representations are permuted under automorphisms. After this, for d\u0026gt;6, we fail.\nIn a straightforward construction, it is obvious that 9d SCFTs do not exist simply from this fact. Nonetheless, one could persevere and hope that somehow, for Carroll SCFTs, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold. Indeed, when studying the theory, we do get some interesting behavior. In the Carroll limit, the Hamiltonian becomes central and the (finite part of the) algebra becomes iso(d+1).\nIn smaller words, the effective \u0026ldquo;dimension\u0026rdquo; compared to regular CFTs drops by one. You can immediately see this by looking at unitarity bounds with descendants. Say, from the scalar primaries $$||a^{\\mu \\nu} P_\\mu P_\\nu \\ket{[0]_\\Delta}||\\geq0$$ we get $$\\frac{d-3}{2} \\geq \\Delta \\text{ instead of }\\frac{d-2}{2}.$$ With some more tedious calculations, you will find the same for vectors and spinors. You are effectively left with all the interesting dynamics going on in the other d-1 dimensions once the Hamiltonian becomes central, so all one needs to do is find a spinorial representation for so(d+1). Assuming the same reasoning holds, this all suggests that Carroll SCFTs can exist in 7 dimensions.\nDead Ends #\rSo this kind of puts a damper on finding a 9d dual to flat space in 10d. Something more complicated is going on and in taking the limit for \\(R \\rightarrow \\infty\\), one needs to be more careful.\nAt least 7d SCFTs probably works. Is there something interesting to do here? Maybe. Do I care? Not really.\nIt is well known that the super-BMS group is good for any dimension. BMS is the algebra one finds at null infinity for asymptotic flat spaces. In addition to regaining Poincare, you get an infinite algebra. It has been conjectured that superconformal Carroll in d is isomorphic to super-BMS in d+1. This has been tested up to 4d (as far as I know, maybe 5d?) but this seems to suggest this isomorphism does not hold for arbitrary dimension.\nFor now, it seems a bottom up approach would be more fruitful in establishing a dictionary. As of now, I\u0026rsquo;m working on taking the Carroll limit directly of 4d SYM. This seems to be producing some more directly interesting things\u0026hellip;\n","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/scft/dead-ends/","section":"Posts","summary":"Every now and then, one pursues an idea thinking it could lead to something interesting, but then soon finds a dead end.","title":"Dead Ends, Flat Holography, and 7d SCFTs","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rOperators and Black Hole Info #\rToday, the arxivs have graced us with a paper on An Operator Algebraic Approach To Black Hole Information by van der Heijden and Verlinde. In it, they describe using the operator algebra picture to describe some concepts in the information paradox and particularly focus on times much later than the page time. Specifically, they look at the limits with \\(G \\rightarrow 0\\) and fixed inverse temperature \\( \\beta\\), and are able to say some very interesting things regarding how Bob can reconstruct the dictionary Alice has (rudely) thrown in.\nThey mainly focus on type I algebras and show in the limit of above, they are able to get II without the crossed product. This is extremely interesting as there may be a hope to unite the type I description (and all the unitary-ness) with the type III geometric picture. Really, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like anything would stop one from adopting Hong and Sam\u0026rsquo;s approach to push to a type III.\nThis also seems like a natural language to talk about QES and Islands as well.\nComplexity #\rComplexity, in QIS, has a well known interpretation. It is (roughly) the number of unitaries I need to apply to a reference state to get to a chosen state. Despite this, the notion of complexity in QFTs, with its infinite degrees of freedom, is hard to understand. As far as I am aware, there isn\u0026rsquo;t any concrete proposal that is widely accepted at this point.\nAt most, there are some notions of placing the theory on a lattice with some small gate set and asserting that this gives a good notion of complexity, though this is ultimately just reducing back to a Type I system. In my opinion, its not really studying (local) QFT (which should directly be III).\nIt seems like a good notion of complexity may exist in the framework of Algebraic QFT. Indeed, Hollands and Ranallo have proposed a measure of channel complexity based on Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) divergence (essentially a generalization of Araki relative entropy, BS can apply to non faithful states) $$ D_{BS}(\\phi||\\psi) = \\sup_{x} \\sup_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\left(\\phi(1) \\log n - \\int_{1/n}^\\infty \\left[ \\phi(x_t x_t^*) + \\frac{1}{t} \\psi(y_t y_t^*) \\right]\\frac{dt}{t} \\right)$$ where the complexity of the channels is $$c(T)=D(id||T).$$Notably, the only non-infinite complexities are those of conditional expectation values. Channels that act as unitaries give infinite complexity. Beyond this, the behaviors of this function seem to satisfy what one would want from complexity, additivity, monoticity, positive definiteness, etc.\nIt seems like a nice interpretation may be channel complexity is how hard it is to perform a measurement.\nComplexity for Black Holes? #\rIt is yet to be seen whether the definition of complexity above is relevant everywhere. A place where complexity pops up over and over is holography, where there seems to be some interpretation in the bulk (yet not on the QFT). This provides a decent playground for initial tests.\nA very quick check one may do is as follows:\nIn the paper above, at late time, much past the page time, an evaporating black hole of mass \\(M\\) goes to \\(M-E\\). They respectively have algebras \\(\\mathcal M\\) and \\(\\mathcal N\\) respectively with \\(\\mathcal N \\subset \\mathcal M\\). The Jones index, essentially a measure of the relative size between the two algebras, goes as $$[\\mathcal M : \\mathcal N] = \\exp 2 \\beta E.$$ Of course, this is mediated by a channel with conditional expectation value $$\\epsilon : \\mathcal M \\rightarrow \\mathcal N.$$ This quantity is related to how much information Bob can get from whatever Alice threw in at the beginning. The complexity for the BS divergence gives a very concrete answer to this, for a channel defined above $$c(\\epsilon) = \\log [\\mathcal M : \\mathcal N].$$ If we call this the complexity, we get $$c(\\epsilon) = 2 \\beta E$$ which is what one would expect to get! The complexity scales linearly at late times, as expected. Maybe this complexity is related to how difficult it is for Bob to measure outgoing radiation of interest? There is some heavy work that needs to be done for interpretation.\nThere seems to be something very tangible here that still needs to be ironed out! The above construction works in the I and II case but we are primarily interested in III. Nonetheless, the above calculations are all well defined in the type III case, so one should be able to push the construction analogous to Hong and Sam. Though in all likelyhood, it would involve hijinks with the modular operator \\(\\Delta^{is}\\).\nThis seems like a promising avenue, and it should be possible to describe the complexity of items of interest, maybe QES, islands, etc. If nothing else, the operator algebra approach seems well suited to many of these issues. Hopefully, this measure of complexity is what we want for QFT. I\u0026rsquo;ve only been looking at van der Heijden and Verlinde\u0026rsquo;s construction for a few hours, so perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll find a nice cafe and do some more serious calculations this weekend.\nTime will tell if this is the correct avenue\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/complexity/algebraic-complexity/","section":"Posts","summary":"Operators and Black Hole Info #\rToday, the arxivs have graced us with a paper on An Operator Algebraic Approach To Black Hole Information by van der Heijden and Verlinde.","title":"On Complexity in QFT and Algebras","type":"posts"},{"content":"It seems I will be here for a while, so I might as well make a list of all the coffee shops I\u0026rsquo;ve been to.

Score are subject to change if I go back.\nSHOPS #\rFirst Light Book Shop (4.25/5) #\r4 for Coffee\n4.5 for Aesthetic Nice book selection Orders Generally, places with a very nice aesthetic don\u0026rsquo;t have amazing coffee in my experience. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised when I got an excellent cortado rather late at night. I need to go back and try more things, but my one experience so far has been nothing but good.\nVibe As the name suggests, this place is a coffee shop. They have a good amount of indoor seating among the book shelves and a lot of outdoor seating. The area is in Hyde park, so a bit of a quieter part of North Austin. The detailing and ambiance of the store is great and has a nice laid back vibe. I see some people there studying, some there just to read books. I know they have events some times but I have yet to go to one. It is also nice that they are open until 9 PM.\nIn all, nothing beats drinking coffee while reading in a corner, or browsing books.\nTerrible Love(4/5) #\r+ Excellent coffee + Good texture drinks - Outside seating - No baked goods\n5 for Coffee\n3 for Aesthetic Orders Absolutely excellent cortado. The notes come through clear as day. The milk has just the right texture to accompany the coffee. They also have very good tea. Besides these two items, they don\u0026rsquo;t sell any baked goods, which I miss.\nVibe It\u0026rsquo;s a coffee cart next to a building and there is no indoor seating. Yet, it still seems to have a nice vibe. There are some tables to the side. When it\u0026rsquo;s not too hot outside, it is a nice place to hang around.\nUpdate: They have moved into an actual building with a singular window wher you can order.\nFigure 8(4/5) #\r+ Excellent coffee + Good texture drinks + Excellent light roasts - Limited seating\n5 for Coffee\n3 for Aesthetic Orders Another excellent cortado. The one I had was very light but not too acidic to where I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if they used natural processed (or at least honey).\nVibe It is at a strip mall so the vibe is alright and they have a big window looking out into the parking lot. The interior furniture is quite industrial but the décor is not bad. The closer you sit to the counter the better imo.\nBarrett\u0026rsquo;s Coffee(3.5/5) #\r+ Above average coffee + Good roasters with great rotating selection + Also has great natural processed coffee\n4 for Coffee\n3 for Aesthetic Orders When in Austin and needing a bag of coffee, I will usually choose Barrett\u0026rsquo;s. As a roaster they go above expectations. With the free drink I get, I almost always get a cortado, which depending on the day, could be natural processed or a blend of several different origins.\nVibe Also a dark wooden Aesthetic, lots of seating and a good mix of people working and discussing. there are loads of coffee equipment lining the walls and you can sometimes see them pulling out bags of coffee to roast in the back. A bit industrial for me, but overall very nice.\népicerie (3.5/5) #\r+ Very nice interior and design + Amazing pastries (particularly the Beignets ) - The most mid coffee I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had - A restaurant, not just a coffee place\n3 for Coffee\n4 for Aesthetic Excellent Beignets Orders For full transparency, this place is a restaurant, though you can go in and order coffee at the counter. The coffee itself is the very definition of average. I got a cortado which was what I think of exactly whenever some one mentions \u0026ldquo;cortado\u0026rdquo;. The pastries are excellent and this is the one place in Austin you can get good Beignets. I would come to this place just for the pastries.\nVibe The location is in a quite part of North Austin. There is a lot of natural light and some outside seating as well. It is a restaurant so you can go and get food if you want. The décor is very nice and the environment is nicely lit and cozy.\nCivil Goat(2.75/5) #\r+ Good Lemon tart + Excellent Aesthetic - Okay coffee, mainly drowned out by the milk\n2 for Coffee\n3.5 for Aesthetic Orders The cortado I ordered here was not bad at all, though a bit safe for what I like. The taste and texture of the mild really dominated. Excellent lemon tart though.\nVibe I really like the Aesthetic of Civil goat. It has a nice soft modern finish with a nice view of the street. It was extremely busy when I went which I dislike and it looked as if everyone was concentrating on work,\nFlat Track Coffee(2.75/5) #\r+ Good coffee with decent selection - A bit of a commercial/industrial feel\n4 for Coffee\n1.5 for Aesthetic Orders Pretty good coffee, the cortado I ordered was a very nice natural processed Ethiopian. I also got some of their coffee that they roasted which I quite enjoyed.\nVibe The location a bit more south of Austin. The vibes were not bad, they did employ a decent amount of wood but the place felt a bit too industrial for me. There\u0026rsquo;s a large Bike rack at the front and I have been told that is where several group rides start/end from.\nMedici (2.25/5) #\r+ Nice aesthetic on 2nd floor with good view of outside street + Decent selection of coffee beans - Felt extremely commercial with too much merch being sold\n2.5 for Coffee\n2 for Aesthetic Orders I initially asked for an ice pour over to which the response was, \u0026ldquo;the pour over machine is broken\u0026rdquo; which I did not understand. I asked if he could do a manual pour over on a V60, Kalita, or ChemeX, but while these were available, he clearly did not want to make it, and bemoaned how long it would take. Instead I got their \u0026ldquo;flash brew\u0026rdquo;, a variation of their cold brew which used fermented, washed Ethiopians. For a \u0026ldquo;cold brew\u0026rdquo; it was as good as a cold brew could be. The pain au chocolat was nice. All in all not bad but not the greatest.\nVibe At initial glance, the vibe is nice. Plus points for wooden aesthetic with a large 1st and 2nd floor. The upstairs is a nice place to work, though clearly the furniture is a bit old and rickety. The wifi was quite slow, though I will not penalize them for this. The barista clearly knew what he was talking about and pointed out several coffee beans when I asked about them that were interesting to me. There is merch on the first floor which seems very out of place.\nBennu (Highland)(2.25/5) #\r1 for Coffee\n3.5 for Aesthetic Open 24/7 Orders I got a cortado and was immediately revolted by what touched my tongue. It was extremely dark and on top of that, tasted sour, so it seems like the shot was not even pulled correctly. I wanted to get a pastry but there were none available. It was midnight so I won\u0026rsquo;t hold it against them.\nVibe The location is right in front of Austin Community College so it is usually filled with students. I went around midnight and brought a (this) book to read and saw several people studying or having group discussions. The décor is nice (and consistent). I might go back if I need some late night caffeine outside of the house, or to grade homeworks/exams next time.\nLucky Lab Coffee Co. (2/5) #\r+ Inside aesthetic is nice + Has pretty good baked goods - Dark roast coffee primarily - Little inside seating and feels congested\n2 for Coffee\n2 for Aesthetic Good bakery Orders I got a cappuccino and was asked the dreaded question, \u0026ldquo;what size?\u0026rdquo; I was quite disappointed to hear this and if I were not meeting friends there, would have immediately left. Instead, I asked for the 12 oz. The coffee was a dark roast with too much milk to have any discernable notes.\nI recently went back and got a pastry which was rather good. I cannot say anything besides that. Vibe The location is not bad and is very close to the UT campus. It seems the base is largely students. The inside is nice with a wooden aesthetic which I enjoy. Unfortunately the only seating inside is at the bar. It seems they also have a kitchen for food. The majority of the seating is outside shared with several other stores. It is nice, but not when it is 104 F outside. I was miserable and quickly left after my friends arrived.\nFlightpath Coffeehouse (1.75) #\r+ Inside aesthetic is nice + Has pretty good cake + Lot of seating inside - Dark roast coffee primarily - Not the best quality coffee\n1.5 for Coffee\n2 for Aesthetic Orders I got a cortado which was rough, but the slice of chocolate cake was quite good.\nVibe Similar in vibe to Epoch or Sweet Eugenes which is in College Station. Its a darkly lit venue found in Hyde Park and there is some nice outside seating as well. Not my vibe but I can see other people really liking it.\nSpokesman (1.5/5) #\r2 for Coffee\n1 for Aesthetic Orders The cortado here was not bad, but nothing to write home about. A bit too dark for me and the milk dominated anyways. Their Italian soda really hits the spot though.\nVibe It is right outside a climbing gym so the location is nice to go to before or after. I\u0026rsquo;m not too much of a fan of their décor and the look is very industrial to me.\nEpoch Coffee (?) #\r0.5 for Coffee\n? for Aesthetic Open 24/7 They have coffee Must go late night Orders I got what was technically a cortado.\nVibe During the day, Epoch is a normal coffee shop, during the night, well\u0026hellip;\nI went in knowing that the coffee wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the best. I also went in knowing late at night, there are some\u0026hellip; interesting events that happen at night. I was told by a friend that last time she went, late at night, she saw a someone randomly reading Jackson electrodynamics, not because he did physics or something, but just that he enjoyed it.\nWhen I went, I sat outside with my coffee and watched the crowd. At some point (this was around 1 AM) sat at a table outside, pulled a whole computer setup out, and started playing video games. + points for the cat that came up to me and let me pet it for a while.\nWill definitely go back.\n","date":"28 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/coffee/coffee-in-austin/","section":"Posts","summary":"It seems I will be here for a while, so I might as well make a list of all the coffee shops I\u0026rsquo;ve been to.","title":"Coffee in Austin","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rEdit 29 Sep 2024: At some point I\u0026rsquo;d like to revisit this. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I did a very good job describing this for a \u0026ldquo;Layman\u0026rdquo;.\nIntroduction #\rImagine a 3d solid cylinder. The 2d \u0026ldquo;boundary\u0026rdquo; is what wraps the cylinder (the thing with area \\( A=2\\pi R h\\) ) while the 3d \u0026ldquo;bulk\u0026rdquo; is the inside of the cylinder. As another example, if you take a soda can, the \u0026ldquo;bulk\u0026rdquo; is the soda and the \u0026ldquo;boundary is the aluminum.\u0026rdquo; Now if you walk around the boundary of the cylinder, hit it with a hammer, or otherwise do any action on the surface, there is an entirely equivalent process happening inside the bulk. In other words, just by studying the boundary of this cylinder, I can understand what is happening inside. This is the essence of holography. Who is this for? #\rPart of what I do in Physics is doing Holography (AKA AdS/CFT Correspondence, Gauge/Gravity Duality, etc.) As a slightly ambitious topic, I\u0026rsquo;d like to attempt making a (somewhat) Laymen\u0026rsquo;s guide. There are certainly many pop science articles and videos on the internet that explain the topic, but in a largely handwavy manner that I find not very satisfying. On the other hand, if you try to go deeper, you will quickly find that most sources expect you to have some knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR) to make some headway. This post is dedicated to those in between, maybe having a background in science or math, but not knowing the aforementioned fields (pun non intended).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll have to delay discussions of stacking D-branes, computing correlators, or entanglement entropy to another day. For now, if you have any background in QFT/GR, I find Veronica Hubeny\u0026rsquo;s note a wonderful introduction. If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like reading on, I\u0026rsquo;ll write the thesis here:\n$$\\text{Quantum Gravity in D dim} \\cong \\text{Gauge Theory in D-1 dim}.$$ In other words, for a quantum gravity (QG) theory living on some space D-dismensional space \\(\\mathcal M \\), a gauge theory (a QFT) on the boundary of the space, \\( \\partial \\mathcal{M} \\), can explain the dynamics of \\(\\mathcal M \\). In this case, we say the theory on \\(\\mathcal M \\) is dual to the theory on its boundary \\( \\partial \\mathcal{M} \\). This is also knows as the Holographic Principle.\nThe organization is as follows.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do I care?\u0026rdquo; details some introduction on why one would want to study holography \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; draws some inspiration from black holes \u0026ldquo;AdS/CFT\u0026rdquo; provides a concrete model realizing holography. On first readthrough, this section can be skipped \u0026ldquo;All Thogether Now\u0026rdquo; restates the keypoints of the previous section and \u0026lsquo;derives\u0026rsquo; the duality \u0026ldquo;The Real World\u0026rdquo; ends with some comments on applications and outlooks Why do I care? #\rOur best theories of nature are quantum. The standard model, arguably the most successful model of nature ever made, describes the quantum interactions of fields (like the electromagnetic field \\(\\vec E(x) \\), where there is a value assigned to every point in space. Often we will denote fields as \\(\\phi(x)\\)). This model applies well to (relatively) small scale physics. Included in this are the 3 forces:\nElectromagnetic: Responsible for almost everything in our everyday lives Weak: Responsible for particle decays Strong: What holds quarks together Additionally, we know how QFTs work relatively well. Note QFT is a framework of which there are many concrete models.\nThe other successful theory is GR, which gives us the force of gravity. It predicts several observed phenomenon at large scales including the precession of Mercury, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves.\nTogether, these form our understanding of the universe. Yet, gravity is not included in the standard model. We believe (with good reason) that there should be a force carrying particle called the graviton that is not included. Really what I want, is a theory of quantum gravity which tells me how gravity works at very small scales. This is relevant to regimes like black holes, the big bang, and high energy regimes. This Snowmass whitepaper does a very good job of explaining why QG is important.\nUnfortunately, QG is notoriously difficult. There is a perfectly fine effective field theory, but if I want to describe any regimes of interest, I quickly realize that a naïve quantization wont work. I need new tool to describe QG. This is why I care about holography, it gives me a tool to study a theory of QG, something I don\u0026rsquo;t understand that well) by using a QFT because the physics between these two theories are essentially equivalent.\nAs a general idea, that\u0026rsquo;s all there is to it. For those that want a bit more detail, read on.\nMotivation #\rSpin Lattice #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s consider a cubic box of volume \\(V\\). Subdivide it into smaller boxes with side length \\( a \\) where \\(a^3 \u0026lt; V \\). We want to place a single (distinct) particle inside every single box of side length \\( a \\). This particle has 2 possible states it can be in, up or down. In total, we have $$ \\text{number of particles} = \\frac{V}{a^3}.$$ If we want to count all the configurations my states can take, or multiplicity \\( \\Omega, \\) we just need to add up how many possible permutations of each particle: $$\\Omega = 2^{V/a^3}.$$For example, take a box that has \\(V=2a^3\\), then the multiplicity is \\( \\Omega = 2^2 = 4 \\). To list all of them, we have: UU, UD, DU, or DD. Entropy, \\( S \\), is nothing but the log of multiplicity, which essentially counts the degrees of freedom in the system, or $$S = \\log \\Omega = \\log 2^{\\frac{V}{a^3}} = \\frac{V}{a^3} \\log 2,$$where we see that the entropy is directly proportional to volume. In fact, we could have guessed this. If we make the box of volume \\( V \\) bigger, the entropy should increase directly as well as it is directly related to the number of total particles.\nFun with Black Holes #\rHowever, let\u0026rsquo;s look at a regime of interest for us, black holes. These objects are a high energy theorists playground. They are completely described by their mass, angular momentum, and charge; yet are rich enough to lead to very complex questions. Back in the day, Bekenstein and Hawking showed us that black holes surprisingly have a temperature. Even more surprisingly, the entropy of a black hole is given by $$S_{BH} = \\frac A 4$$where \\( A \\) is the area given by the event horizon. The entropy is not proportional to the volume, but the area! Somehow, when QG enters the picture, we drastically lose a number of my degrees of freedom. This is what led Susskind, t\u0026rsquo;Hooft, and others to propose the so called holographic principle. Somehow, all we need to know about what happens in the black hole, is to study the boundary of it.\nThe study of black holes led to many a research program today. The information paradox, study of entanglement entropies and use of quantities in quantum information science (yes, the same stuff as they use for quantum computers) can all trace their roots back to this.\nAdS/CFT Correspondence #\rSo the entropy of a black hole scales with the area, so what? While there were hints of more concrete models before, it took until Maldacena\u0026rsquo;s 1997 paper where he proposed a correspondence between a theory of QG and a QFT. Arguably, gauge/gravity duality stands on its own two feet, but it has roots in string theory (in Jacques\u0026rsquo; words, the only promising candidate for QG). To state the original correspondence in full, $$\\text{String Theory on } AdS_5\\times S^5 \\cong \\mathcal N = 4 \\text{ SU(N) Super Yang Mills}.$$Don\u0026rsquo;t be overwhelmed at this point, we\u0026rsquo;ll take each point slowly and break the above statement down.\nOn the LHS, string theory is a theory of QG and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) is the spacetime that the string theory \u0026ldquo;lives on\u0026rdquo;. On the RHS, \\(\\mathcal N = 4\\) denotes the amount of supersymmetry, a symmetry between forces and matter, and an SU(N) Super Yang Mills is a CFT (A QFT with conformal invariace, which we will discuss later) analogous to the strong force. It will be helpful to include the math, but I will try to demarcate what the necessary information is so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go into it if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to. This is a concrete realization of the aforementioned holographic principle.\nOn first read through, it is sufficient to skip to \u0026ldquo;All Together Now.\u0026rdquo; The keypoints from the bottom section will be listed.\nDespite my best intentions, the best I can do is a pale mimicry of what AdS/CFT correspondence really is. Without discussing how the correspondence arises, stacking N D3-branes and looking at the perturbative expansion of large N theories and string theory, the understanding is only surface level. You need the math. For those that want this detail, I think Hong Liu\u0026rsquo;s MIT OCW on the topic is excellent and has plenty of exercises. Other than that, for now just trust me.\nGeometry #\rMeasuring Distance #\rIn everyday life, on a flat piece of paper, you will find Euclidean space. Here the shortest point between two lines is a straight line, in other words, to find the distance \\(s\\) between two points, you just need to use the Pythagorean theorem )$$s^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2.$$Instead of using the differences in the two points, let me consider a super small interval, \\(x_2-x_1 = dx\\) or an infinitesimal. Then I can rewrite this as $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2.$$This is a metric, it tells me how to measure the distance on my space. Of course, generally, our space may be curved; for instance: we might be on a sphere. If you have taken a course in multivariable calculus, in the coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\phi)\\), the metric is given by $$ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\text{ } d\\phi^2).$$This is a space with curvature, unlike the Euclidean case.\nWhat about AdS? #\rAdS is also a space with curvature. Notably, it has a boundary. Instead of the 2 dimensional space in the Euclidean example, or the 3 dimensional space of the sphere, \\(AdS_5\\) is 5 dimensional. The \\(S^5\\), denotes the 5 sphere. It means associated to every point in \\(AdS_5\\), there are 5 extra dimensions that look like a sphere. This boundary, when you zoom in on it, looks like 4-d flat space (similar to Euclidean).\nIf you are curious, a metric for AdS (in convenient coordinates) is $$ds^2 = \\frac{R^2}{z^2}(dz^2 -dt^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2).$$ where \\(R\\) is the radius of AdS and \\(z\\) controls how close we are to the boundary. Scaling the metric conformally (see next section) and taking \\(z \\rightarrow 0\\) (to the boundary), we get $$ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2$$ which is the spacetime version of flat.\nNote that symmetries are extremely important in physics. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know what it means, but AdS has an isometry group of SO(2,4) in 5 dimensions.\nSide Note: If you try to visualize a 5d sphere, you will find it quite difficult (impossible). I once had a colleague that worked with a mathematician that studied manifolds. One day, after gaining the experience over decades, he said to my colleague, \u0026ldquo;I think I can start to envision a 3-sphere\u0026rdquo;. So maybe not impossible, you just need a few decades to try and get to a 3-sphere, maybe a few centuries to get to a 5-sphere.\nConformal Field Theory #\rI have struggled with explaining Conformal field theories to a Laymen. At some point I hope to revisit this, but for now, I will state some basic facts.\nAs some groundwork, let me describe the idea of a mapping coordinates. Wecan always choose to take my coordinates from one form to another. As an example, imagine taking Euclidean coordinated from $$x \\rightarrow x\u0026rsquo;= \\lambda x \\quad y \\rightarrow y\u0026rsquo;=\\lambda y$$ where \\(\\lambda\\) is just a number. Then the metric transforms to $$ds\u0026rsquo;^2 = dx\u0026rsquo;^2 + dy\u0026rsquo;^2 = \\lambda^2 (dx^2+dy^2)= \\lambda^2 ds^2.$$This is an example of a simple conformal transformation.\nConformal transformations are special transformations on my coordinates such that my metric changes only by some overall factor $$x \\rightarrow x\u0026rsquo; = f(x) \\quad ds^2 \\rightarrow ds\u0026rsquo;^2 = \\Omega^2(x) ds^2.$$ In response, the fields \\(\\phi(x)\\), which depend on the coordinates, also scale $$\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi\u0026rsquo;(x\u0026rsquo;)=\\lambda^{-\\Delta}\\phi(x)$$where \\(\\Delta\\) is called the scaling dimension. All you need to know is that this is a special type of QFT with some extra symmetries. Notably, CFTs have a conformal symmetry group of SO(2,4).\nString Theory #\rThere are many things I can say about string theory, but let me summarize by saying it is the only promising theory of quantum gravity thus far. Usually, in most areas of physics, we describe particles as point-like (0 dimensional); however, in string theory, the fundamental particle is a string (1-dimensional). We would expect that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t gain much from using a higher dimensional object besides being entangled (pun indented) in a more complex framework.\nIf you quantize (apply the rules of quantum mechanics to) a string, you get an infinite number of states (particles). First starting from massless states, and then going up in mass. Surprisingly, in the very first set of particles you find, the massless ones, you immediately get a graviton.\nThis means by quantizing a string, you immediately get a theory of quantum gravity.\nYou cannot ignore this graviton either. Moreover, string theory is UV complete, meaning that at high energies, the theory is still well controlled; that at high energies wedon\u0026rsquo;t get nonsense answers. This is a feature that the standard model does not possess. If you try to compute the 137th order of \\(\\alpha \\sim 1/137\\) correction to a process in Quantum Electrodynamics, all hell breaks lose.\nOf course, string theory is only consistent in 10 dimensions and has criticisms for \u0026ldquo;testability\u0026rdquo;, but this we will talk about in another post. For now, I will say the swampland program is starting to put some bounds on how QG theories must act and is making predictions for compact dimensions, dark matter, and dark energy. For instance, the force of gravity should go as \\(1/r^3\\) instead of the \\(1/r^2\\) that you learned about in kindergarten when at the micron scale. Right now our tools are good up to 30 microns so this seems possible to test soon.\nPerturbation Theory #\rThe way we calculate physical processes (particles interacting with each other) is usually with perturbation theory. When we analyze a theory, we usually start with a free theory (the particles can\u0026rsquo;t interact with other particles), and then we add the interactions controlled by some number (the coupling) \\(\\lambda\\) which tells me how strong the interaction is. Usually this looks like $$A + \\lambda B + \\lambda^2 C + \\dots$$ where A is part of my free theory, and B,C,D,\u0026hellip; are my interactions. If lambda is small \\(\\lambda \u0026laquo;1\\). I can ignore the other terms D,E,F, etc.\nSo if I want to calculate the probability of a particle interaction, it will usually look like $$ \\text{Prob } = \\lambda a + \\lambda ^2 b + O(\\lambda ^3)$$ where \\(a,b\\) are just some numbers. It turns out that string theory has interactions built in automatically; I do not have to add them by hand. The shape a string traces out is essentially a cylinder, but the interactions look like topologies with a given genus. The coupling for string theory essentially denotes which genus the interaction is taking place over, whether a sphere, torus, or higher genus shape. Summing over all genus gives me the total probability.\nThere is a much richer discussion of couplings to be had using Renormalization Group flow. In fact, AdS/CFT can also be well understood by this, but this is well out of the scope of this introduction. For now, it is sufficient to understand that at different couplings, theories behave differently.\nAll Together Now #\rLets take the keypoints from each section:\nAdS:\n\\(AdS_5 \\times S^5\\) is a 10d theory AdS has a boundary The boundary looks like 4d flat space AdS has isometry SO(2,4) CFT:\nCFTs are a special type of QFT with more symmetries CFTs in 4 dimensions have a have a conformal symmetry group of SO(2,4) The CFT of interest to us is Super Yang Mills (SYM) on 4d flat space String Theory/Perturbation Theory\nIs a theory of Quantum Gravity Couplings dictate how \u0026ldquo;likely\u0026rdquo; an interaction will happen At different couplings, theories behave differently. You can start to see how these two things may start coming together, The symmetry groups of AdS and CFT are the same. Furthermore, it turns out that the structure of the scattering amplitudes (how likely particles scatter off of others), with respect to the couplings, looks exactly the same between string theory and large N \\(SU(N)\\) gauge theories.\nMaldacena made the following insight. String theory in specific configurations, at strong couplings, looks like strings \u0026ldquo;living\u0026rdquo; on AdS. However, at weak couplings, it looks like \\(\\mathcal N = 4 \\quad SU(N) \\) SYM with large N which is geometrically on the boundary of AdS. But because the coupling on the gauge theory should be good anywhere, the conjecture is the full $$\\text{String Theory on } AdS_5\\times S^5 \\cong \\mathcal N = 4 \\text{ SU(N) Super Yang Mills}.$$ The correspondence has been extraordinarily useful and has resulted in a dictionary directly relating objects on the LHS to the RHS.\nThe Real World? #\rAs a whole, AdS/CFT and holography has been extraordinarily useful in exploring quantum gravity and has pushed our understanding of QFT. Despite this, it cannot be denied that we do not apparently live in AdS \\(\\Lambda \u0026lt; 0\\). It appears that our universe has a slight positive curvature, \\(\\Lambda \u0026gt; 0\\) (meaning there is no boundary) which means there is nowhere for our CFT to live if we naively want to consider de Sitter/CFT Correspondence. As a side note, it does seem that recent data from DESI suggests the cosmological constant may not be constant, though let\u0026rsquo;s see if this plays out.\nNonetheless, the program has been extraordinarily useful in explaining general \u0026ldquo;truths\u0026rdquo; about QG, even if they describe another universe. A robust theory of QG is better than no theory of QG. Generically, we are able to leverage AdS/CFT and holography to say things that should apply to any universe.\nBeyond this, it has seeped into condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and many other fields. For instance, you can describe the physics of superconductors with holography or calculate entanglement entropies, complexities for systems (I have thoughts on the complexities of QFT that I will leave for a more technical post) and error correcting codes.\nWhile holography is where this idea is most well understood, there are several other correspondences in other dimensions and with other geometries, including flat and de Sitter. A good chunk of people are now working on how holography may look in flat spacetimes (including me) and the prospects seem to indicate it is possible. There also seems to be some ways of rephrasing the dualities with gravitational algebras which is still a work in progress. Over the past 25 years, it has continued to make great strides and there does not seem to be any stopping for the foreseeable future.\n","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/holography/holography/","section":"Posts","summary":"Edit 29 Sep 2024: At some point I\u0026rsquo;d like to revisit this.","title":"On Holography for Laymen","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"18 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/misc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Misc","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rRecently, I have been thinking to myself more and more that I should have a blog or a website to write down my thoughts. Inspired by several blogs, including Jacques Distler\u0026rsquo;s Blog and finally given the push by an old friend (who kindly walked me through the setup), I have decided to start this blog.\nSomething about having one\u0026rsquo;s own site appeals to me. While twitter (X?), instagram, and other sites are able to share experiences, none of them quite are quite as conducive to documenting thoughts in detail. Of course one should ask next, what do these \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; entail? They should not be too spontaneous as to be worthless (worthless being defined as knowledge that no one, including me, will ever refer to), nor is this the forum to publish ideas that have spent a considerable time being polished (no need to be GRRM or Rothfuss). What that sweet spot is, I am not yet sure.\nPurpose #\rThis brings us to what the blog will be used for.\nLife #\rSince times of antiquity (1990s) blogs have been used to document daily life experiences. While I don\u0026rsquo;t intend for this to be the common use, it is worth mentioning. At the very least, I\u0026rsquo;d like to use this to document various personal events (less so) and thoughts about the world (more so). I say this, but more frivolous uses will be here as well, maybe rating every coffee shop in Austin?\nPhysics #\rSince even more antiquated times (1989), the internet has been used for physics. Taking inspiration from Jacques, I\u0026rsquo;d like to dedicate a portion of this blog to my thoughts on concepts from physics, news, and the general life of an academic. At some point I\u0026rsquo;d like to get Latex running. If the bosonic CFT action $$S = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int d^2z \\partial X \\bar \\partial X$$is displayed I have succeeded, if not, it\u0026rsquo;s a WIP.\nLearning #\rCertainly, it is my job to learn new concepts but by this I mean more that just academic learning. Included in this category I have documenting new life skills, 日本語, and even sports (Has anyone noticed that if you throw a dart into a group of theoretical physicists, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it will land on someone that boulders? This seems to be an international phenomenon, not just relegated to the states). Certainly more will be added.\nRandom thoughts #\rWorthless != random, nor frivolous and I think (roughly) well thought out random thoughts can go in here as well.\nProjects #\rMaybe I can include progress on my personal projects on here, though I am not yet sure. For physics, maybe some updates on what I am personally working on. My background (back in another lifetime) is in computer science so maybe at some point I can consider picking up the rubber ducky again.\nThese are what I envision as I start this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens in the future.\nTODO #\rThe site still needs some setup and there are certain things I\u0026rsquo;d like to add. Latex being priority #1 but I\u0026rsquo;d also like to add a discussion feature. Maybe I can convince Kushal to take interest and be my Prometheus\u0026hellip;\n","date":"18 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/purpose/purpose/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction #\rRecently, I have been thinking to myself more and more that I should have a blog or a website to write down my thoughts.","title":"Purpose","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rThis is a test.
