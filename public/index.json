The 2d \u0026ldquo;boundary\u0026rdquo; is what wraps the cylinder (the thing with area \\( A=2\\pi R h\\) ) while the 3d \u0026ldquo;bulk\u0026rdquo; is the inside of the cylinder (As another example, if you take a soda can, the \u0026ldquo;bulk\u0026rdquo; is the soda and the \u0026ldquo;boundary is the aluminum\u0026rdquo; . Now if you walk around the boundary of the cylinder, hit it with a hammer, or otherwise do any action on the surface, there is an entirely equivalent process happening inside the bulk. In other words, just by probing the boundary of this cylinder, I can understand what is happening in the bulk. This is the essence of holography. Who is this for? #\rPart of what I do in Physics is doing Holography (AKA AdS/CFT Correspondence, Gauge/Gravity Duality, etc.) As a slightly ambitious topic, I\u0026rsquo;d like to attempt making a (somewhat) Laymen\u0026rsquo;s guide. There are certainly many pop science articles and videos on the internet that explain it, but in a largely handwavy manner that is not very satisfying. On the other hand, If you try to go deeper, you will quickly find that most sources expect you to have some knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR) to make some headway. This post is dedicated to those in between, maybe having a background in science or math, but not knowing the aforementioned fields (pun absolutely intended).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll have to delay discussions of stacking D-branes, computing correlators, or entanglement entropy to another day. For now, if you have any background in QFT/GR, I find Veronica Hubeny\u0026rsquo;s note a wonderful introduction. If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like reading on, I\u0026rsquo;ll write the thesis here:\n$$\\text{Quantum Gravity in D dim} \\cong \\text{Gauge Theory in D-1 dim}.$$ In other words, for a quantum gravity (QG) theory living on some space D-dismensional space \\(\\mathcal M \\), a gauge theory (a QFT) on the boundary of the space, \\( \\partial \\mathcal{M} \\), can explain the dynamics of \\(\\mathcal M \\). In this case, we say the theory on \\(\\mathcal M \\) is dual to the theory on its boundary \\( \\partial \\mathcal{M} \\). This is also knows as the Holographic Principle.\nWhy do I care? #\rOur best theories of nature are quantum The standard model, arguably the most accurate model of nature ever made, describes the quantum interactions of fields (like the electromagnetic field \\(\\vec E(x) \\), where there is a value assigned to every point in space. Often we will denote fields as \\(\\phi(x)\\)). This model applies well to (relatively) small scale physics. Included in this are the 3 forces:\nElectromagnetic: Responsible for almost everything in our everyday lives Weak: Responsible for particle decays Strong: What holds quarks together Additionally, we know how QFTs work relatively well (as effective field theories). Note QFT is a framework of which there are many concrete models.\nThe other successful theory is GR, which gives us the force of gravity. It predicts several observed phenomenon at large scales including the precession of Mercury, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves.\nTogether, these form our understanding of the universe and yet, gravity is not included in the standard model. We believe (with good reason) that there should be a force carrying particle called the graviton that just is not there. Really what I want, is a theory of quantum gravity which tells me how gravity works at very small scales. This is relevant to regimes like black holes, the big bang, and high energy regimes. This Snowmass whitepaper does a very good job of explaining why QG is important.\nUnfortunately, QG is notoriously difficult. There is a perfectly fine effective field theory, but if I want to describe any regimes of interest, I quickly realize that a naïve quantization wont work. I need new tool to describe QG. This is why I care about holography, it gives me a tool to study a theory of QG, something I don\u0026rsquo;t understand that well) by using a QFT because the physics between these two theories are essentially equivalent.\nAs a general idea, that\u0026rsquo;s all there is to it. For those that want a bit more detail, read on.\nMotivation #\rSpin Lattice #\rLets consider a cubic box of volume \\(V\\), let\u0026rsquo;s subdivide it into smaller boxes with side length \\( a \\) where \\(a^3 \u0026lt; V \\). I want to place a single (distinct) particle inside every single box of side length \\( a \\). This particle has 2 possible states it can be in, up or down. In total, I have $$ \\text{number of particles} = \\frac{V}{a^3}.$$ If I want to count all the configurations my states can take, or multiplicity \\( \\Omega \\), I just need to add up how many possible permutations of each particle I have which gives me $$\\Omega = 2^{V/a^3}.$$For example, take a box that has \\(V=2a^3\\), then my multiplicity is \\( \\Omega = 2^2 = 4 \\). To list all of them, we have: UU, UD, DU, or DD. Entropy, \\( S \\), is nothing but the log of my multiplicity, which essentially counts the degrees of freedom in my system, or $$S = \\log \\Omega = \\log 2^{\\frac{V}{a^3}} = \\frac{V}{a^3} \\log 2,$$where we see that the entropy is directly proportional to volume. In fact, you could have guessed this. If I make the box of volume \\( V \\) bigger, the entropy should increase directly as well as it is directly related to the number of total particles.\nFun with Black Holes #\rHowever, let\u0026rsquo;s look at a regime of interest for us, black holes. These objects are a high energy theorists playground, they are completely described by their mass, angular momentum, and charge, yet are rich enough to lead to very complex questions. Back in the day, Bekenstein and Hawking showed us that black holes surprisingly have a temperature. Even more surprisingly, the entropy of a black hole is given by $$S_{BH} = \\frac A 4$$where \\( A \\) is the area given by the event horizon. The entropy is not proportional to the volume, but the area! Somehow, when QG enters the picture, I drastically lose a number of my degrees of freedom. This is what led Susskind, t\u0026rsquo;Hooft, and others to propose the so called holographic principle. Somehow, all I need to know about what happens in the black hole, is to study the boundary of it.\nThe study of black holes led to many a research program today. The information paradox, study of entanglement entropies and use of quantities in quantum information science (yes, the same stuff as they use for quantum computers) can all trace their roots back to this.\nAdS/CFT Correspondence #\rSo the entropy of a black hole scales with the area, so what? While there were hints of more concrete models before, it took until Maldacena\u0026rsquo;s 1997 paper where he proposed a correspondence between a theory of QG and a QFT. Arguably, gauge/gravity duality stands on its own two feet, but it has roots in string theory (in Jacques\u0026rsquo; words, the only promising candidate for QG). To state the original correspondence in full, $$\\text{String Theory on } AdS_5\\times S^5 \\cong \\mathcal N = 4 \\text{ SU(N) Gauge theory}.$$Don\u0026rsquo;t be overwhelmed at this point, we\u0026rsquo;ll take each point slowly and break the above statement down.\nOn the LHS, string theory is a theory of QG and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) is the spacetime that the string theory \u0026ldquo;lives on\u0026rdquo;. On the RHS, \\(\\mathcal N = 4\\) denotes the amount of supersymmetry, a symmetry between forces and matter, and an SU(N) Gauge theory is a CFT (A QFT with conformal invariace, which we will discuss later) analogous to the strong force. It will be helpful to include the math, but I will try to demarcate what the necessary information is so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go into it if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to. This is a concrete realization of the aforementioned holographic principle.\nDespite my best intentions, the best I can do is a pale mimicry of what AdS/CFT correspondence really is. Without discussing how the correspondence arises, stacking N D3-branes and looking at the perturbative expansion of large N theories and string theory, the understanding is only surface level. You need the math. For those that want this detail, I think Hong Liu\u0026rsquo;s MIT OCWon the topic is excellent and has plenty of exercises. Other than that, for now just trust me.\nAnti-de Sitter space #\rMeasuring Distance #\rIn everyday life, on a flat piece of paper, you will find Euclidean space. Here the shortest point between two lines is a straight line, in other words, to find the distance \\(s\\) between two points, you just need to use the Pythagorean theorem )$$s^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2.$$Instead of using the differences in the two points, let me consider a super small interval, \\(x_2-x_1 = dx\\) or an infinitesimal. Then I can rewrite this as $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2.$$This is a metric, it tells me how to measure the distance on my space. Of course, generally, our space may be curved; for instance: we might be on a sphere. If you have taken a course in multivariable calculus, in the coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\phi)\\), the metric is given by $$ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\text{ } d\\phi^2).$$This is a space with curvature, unlike the Euclidean case.\nIn 5d? #\rAdS is also a space with curvature. Notably, it has a boundary. Instead of the 2 dimensional space in the Euclidean example, or the 3 dimensional space of the sphere, \\(AdS_5\\) is 5 dimensional. The \\(S^5\\), denotes the 5 sphere. It means associated to every point in \\(AdS_5\\), there are 5 extra dimensions that look like a sphere. This boundary, when you zoom in on it, looks like 4-d flat space (similar to Euclidean).\nNote that symmetries are extremely important in physics. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know what it means, but AdS has an isometry group of SO(2,4) in 5 dimensions.\nKey Points:\n\\(AdS_5 \\times S^5\\) is a 10d theory AdS has a boundary The boundary looks like 4d flat space AdS has isometry SO(2,4) Side Note: If you try to visualize a 5d sphere, you will find it quite difficult (impossible). I once had a colleague that worked with a mathematician that studied manifolds. One day, after gaining the experience over decades, he said to my colleague, \u0026ldquo;I think I can start to envision a 3-sphere\u0026rdquo;. So maybe not impossible, you just need a few decades to try and get to a 3-sphere, maybe a few centuries to get to a 5-sphere.\nConformal Field Theory #\rI have struggled with explaining Conformal field theories to a Laymen. At some point I hope to revisit this, but for now, I will state some basic facts.\nAs some groundwork, let me describe the idea of a mapping coordinates. I can always choose to take my coordinates from one form to another. As an example, imagine taking Euclidean coordinated from $$x \\rightarrow x\u0026rsquo;= \\lambda x \\quad y \\rightarrow y\u0026rsquo;=\\lambda y$$ where \\(\\lambda\\) is just a number. Then the metric transforms to $$ds\u0026rsquo;^2 = dx\u0026rsquo;^2 + dy\u0026rsquo;^2 = \\lambda^2 (dx^2+dy^2)= \\lambda^2 ds^2.$$This is an example of a simple conformal transformation.\nConformal transformations are special transformations on my coordinates such that my metric changes only by some overall factor $$x \\rightarrow x\u0026rsquo; = f(x) \\quad ds^2 \\rightarrow ds\u0026rsquo;^2 = \\Omega^2(x) ds^2.$$ In response, the fields \\(\\phi(x)\\), which depend on the coordinates, also scale $$\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi\u0026rsquo;(x\u0026rsquo;)=\\lambda^{-\\Delta}\\phi(x)$$where \\(\\Delta\\) is called the scaling dimension. All you need to know is that this is a special type of QFT with some extra symmetries. Notably, CFTs have a conformal symmetry group of SO(2,4).\nKey Points:\nCFTs are a special type of QFT with more symmetries CFTs in 4 dimensions have a have a conformal symmetry group of SO(2,4) String Theory #\rThere are many things I can say about string theory, but let me summarize by saying it is the only promising theory of quantum gravity thus far. Usually, in most areas of physics, we describe particles as point-like (0 dimensional); however, in string theory, the fundamental particle is a string (1-dimensional). We would expect that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t gain much from using a higher dimensional object besides being entangled (pun indented) in a more complex framework.\nIf you quantize (apply the rules of quantum mechanics to) a string, you get an infinite number of states (particles). First starting from massless states, and then going up in mass. Surprisingly, in the very first set of particles you find, the massless ones, you immediately get a graviton.\nThis means by quantizing a string, you immediately get a theory of quantum gravity.\nYou cannot ignore this graviton either. Moreover, string theory is UV complete, meaning that at high energies, the theory is still well controlled; that at high energies I don\u0026rsquo;t get nonsense answers. This is a feature that the standard model does not possess. If you try to compute the 137th order of \\(\\alpha \\sim 1/137\\) correction to a process in Quantum Electrodynamics, all hell breaks lose.\nPerturbation Theory #\rThe way we calculate physical processes (particles interacting with each other) is usually with perturbation theory. When I analyze a theory, I usually start with a free theory (the particles can\u0026rsquo;t interact with other particles), and then I add the interactions controlled by some number (the coupling) \\(\\lambda\\) which tells me how strong the interaction is. Usually this looks like $$A + \\lambda B + \\lambda^2 C + \\dots$$ where A is part of my free theory, and B,C,D,\u0026hellip; are my interactions. If lambda is small \\(\\lambda \u0026laquo;1\\). I can ignore the other terms D,E,F, etc.\nSo if I want to calculate the probability of a particle interaction, it will usually look like $$ \\text{Prob } = \\lambda a + \\lambda ^2 b + O(\\lambda ^3)$$ where \\(a,b\\) are just some numbers. It turns out that string theory has interactions built in automatically; I do not have to add them by hand. The shape a string traces out is essentially a cylinder, but the interactions look like topologies with a given genus. The coupling for string theory essentially denotes which genus the interaction is taking place over, whether a sphere, torus, or higher genus shape. Summing over all genus gives me the total probability.\nOf course, string theory is only consistent in 10 dimensions and has criticisms for \u0026ldquo;testability\u0026rdquo;, but this we will talk about in a few sections time.\nAll Together Now #\rThe Real World? #\r","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/holography/holography/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction #\rImagine a 3d solid cylinder.","title":"On Holography for Laymen","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/physics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Physics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/yasin/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Yasin","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Yasin Alam","summary":"","title":"Yasin Alam","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"18 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/misc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Misc","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rRecently, I have been thinking to myself more and more that I should have a blog or a website to write down my thoughts. Inspired by several blogs, including Jacques Distler\u0026rsquo;s Blog and finally given the push by an old friend (who kindly walked me through the setup), I have decided to start this blog.\nSomething about having one\u0026rsquo;s own site appeals to me. While twitter (X?), instagram, and other sites are able to share experiences, none of them quite are quite as conducive to documenting thoughts in detail. Of course one should ask next, what do these \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; entail? They should not be too spontaneous as to be worthless (worthless being defined as knowledge that no one, including me, will ever refer to), nor is this the forum to publish ideas that have spent a considerable time being polished (no need to be GRRM or Rothfuss).

While I don\u0026rsquo;t intend for this to be the common use, it is worth mentioning. At the very least, I\u0026rsquo;d like to use this to document various personal events (less so) and thoughts about the world (more so). I say this, but more frivolous uses will be here as well, maybe rating every coffee shop in Austin?\nPhysics #\rSince even more antiquated times (1989), the internet has been used for physics. Taking inspiration from Jacques, I\u0026rsquo;d like to dedicate a portion of this blog to my thoughts on concepts from physics, news, and the general life of an academic. At some point I\u0026rsquo;d like to get Latex running. If the bosonic CFT action $$S = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int d^2z \\partial X \\bar \\partial X$$is displayed I have succeeded, if not, it\u0026rsquo;s a WIP.\nLearning #\rCertainly, it is my job to learn new concepts but by this I mean more that just academic learning. Included in this category I have documenting new life skills, 日本語, and even sports (Has anyone noticed that if you throw a dart into a group of theoretical physicists, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it will land on someone that boulders? This seems to be an international phenomenon, not just relegated to the states). Certainly more will be added.\nRandom thoughts #\rWorthless != random, nor frivolous and I think (roughly) well thought out random thoughts can go in here as well.\nProjects #\rMaybe I can include progress on my personal projects on here, though I am not yet sure. For physics, maybe some updates on what I am personally working on. My background (back in another lifetime) is in computer science so maybe at some point I can consider picking up the rubber ducky again.\nThese are what I envision as I start this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens in the future.\nTODO #\rThe site still needs some setup and there are certain things I\u0026rsquo;d like to add. Latex being priority #1 but I\u0026rsquo;d also like to add a discussion feature.
