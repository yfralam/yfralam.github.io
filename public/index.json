Before what I know becomes too outdated, I\u0026rsquo;d like to detail my experience doing research on AI, some general thoughts on where AI is now, and why I decided to (for the most part) leave the field.\nOf course, one should take this entire manuscript with a heavy pinch of salt. One should always take care to not place much weight on people that speak outside of their fields. Much of what will be said here is opinion, and the scientific remarks may or may not be right (or simply just outdated). I am more than happy to be corrected in discussions.\nAs the manuscript was getting a bit long, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to split this into two parts, with the first being more my personal experience, and the second being some criticisms and opinions.\nIntroduction #\rI should take some time to set up my (few) credentials and some context. I completed my CS degree at Texas A\u0026amp;M In the Fall of 2022. Up to this point, I was decently involved and kept up with AI research. I was mainly doing work on Reinforcement Learning (RL) under Yoonsuck Choe; an excellent AI researcher mainly working on AI in the way I envisioned one should be doing it, really studying the inner workings of AI through the lens of neuroscience (as opposed to adding 47 more layers to a neural network (NN), spending millions training it, then declaring success).\nTo summarize the last part of the title, here are the bullet points of what led me to leave computer science:\nI simply liked physics more and thought there were deeper, more crucial questions to ask in this field. I did not like the direction AI was going when I was finishing up my degree. It turns out, after three years of suffering through a CS degree, I really, really hate coding. While I was rather confident that I wanted to continue on in physics in grad school, what really cemented this in my brain was an interaction in my AI class. I remember a guest lecturer stood at the podium, asked if anyone here was a physicist, and when I raised my hand, looked into my eyes and said, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to say this, but physics is a dead field, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing more to discover. All future interesting discoveries will be in the field of artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo;. This statement was so preposterous I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the words to reply. Off the top of my head, I could list off a dozen open issue that would have massive implications for our understanding of the universe or technologies.\nAt this point I realized that, although AI research was were interesting (and profitable), my heart was really with physics.\nLastly, I never really had the patience for coding. Especially with regards to AI, it always felt like an obstacle to getting the results that I wanted; however, CS is much more than coding, and this point I will save for last.\nMy Work #\rHere I\u0026rsquo;ll detail exactly what I did for research, some good points, and some points where I really dropped the ball. To start off, I need to describe reinforcement learning (RL).\nIn my opinion, RL is probably the most robust form of AI and the most likely to provide insight into intelligence or sentience. It lends itself to experiments and playgrounds very naturally. You can use the framework in real world simulations, video games, or interactions.\nAs opposed to setups where the problem is a black box:\nGive the NN an image and it tells us if it is a cat or dog (say YOLO), Given a word, predict the next word (say chat-gpt), the setup for RL has an agent living in an environment. The agent can act on the environment, and in response, the environment can act on the agent.\nQuick Intro to RL #\rI worked in the subfield of AI called RL. Really I should talk about Markov Decision Processes, but that is too much depth. All you need to know is that the setup consists of an environment \\(\\mathcal E\\), an agent that can do some action \\(\\mathcal A\\), and a reward \\(\\mathcal R\\) that the environment gives the agent depending on whether the agent did something desirable. The canonical example is cartpole (which my friend did an intro to here). Essentially, the setup is a cart that is trying to balance a pole. When the cart moves to the left or right (does \\(\\mathcal A\\) ), \\(\\mathcal E\\) sees whether the pole is still balanced or not and gives the agent \\(\\mathcal R\\) accordingly. Intrinsic Motivation #\rNote that in the previous example, \\(\\mathcal E\\) was responsible for giving a reward. There are also systems where instead of the environment giving the reward, the agent draws a reward from themselves without regards to the the environment. This is called intrinsic motivation. For example, curiosity $$ \\mathcal R = \\begin{cases} 0 \u0026amp; \\mathcal A \\text{ has already been done before} \\\\ 1 \u0026amp; \\mathcal A \\text{ has never been done before} \\ \\end{cases} $$ where the agent gets a reward if it does something novel. An interesting exhibition of this can be found here, where a group of researcher using intrinsic motivation to train Mario.\nDetails can be found in my thesis where I tried to study intrinsic motivation and tried to disentangle intrinsic motivation from extrinsic motivation (actions taken due to feedback from \\(\\mathcal E\\) ). I essentially found that spikes in improvement of the agent were correlated (or sometimes even preceded) by spike in intrinsic motivation.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll save you the trouble of opening the link, I truly think this is a terrible thesis.\nThe Bad #\rI wanted to propose a metric for intrinsic motivation using information theory, but the \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo; is mathematically not even a metric. The environments were too simple: even if the \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo; had worked, the agents did not display complex enough behavior to where one could meaningfully, experimentally, seen a big difference I did not do my diligence for literature review. While not studied explicitly in the context of intrinsic motivation, studies of AI with information theory are certainly not new. I did not take a careful look at these. I spent way too much time trying to think of a theoretical framework in which to work in instead of just coding agents and studying information theoretic quantities of these agents. I was much too focused on developing a whole \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo; when I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have any experiments to base my theory off of. In physics, we at least have sacred concepts like like symmetries and unitarity to keep us from writing down anything. For what I was doing, I either did not have these, or didn\u0026rsquo;t know I had these.\nIn short, I was too ambitious and really didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThe Good #\rDespite these short comings, there are a few points in this thesis that are morally interesting.\nThe idea to describe intrinsic motivation with information theoretic is not a bad one. Instead of jumping straight to trying to define a \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo;, it is interesting enough (and I should have) to consider entropies of the agent, environment, and rewards as the system evolves, or the mutual information between them.\nThis is the direction my advisor was pushing me towards. Take different agents and environments and just ask what the info quantities look like. Whether by arrogance, or laziness to avoid coding more, I decided to ignore this advice. If I could go back, this is the main thing I would change, and leave finding a \u0026ldquo;metric\u0026rdquo; to some future goal.\nThe model was small enough to where internal dynamics of the agent could studied. It is said that AI are black boxes to which their inner workings cannot be explained. This is virtually true. Todays powerful AI models are so big that trying to describe their internal dynamics is almost impossible. They are, for all intents and purposes, black boxes that we just hit run on and pray work.\nI chose rather small agents (In terms of size of NNs) to work with such that I could describe the aforementioned quantities explicitly. While I don\u0026rsquo;t think the approach is new, exploring the internal dynamics of an agent to fully grasp what the (to borrow a phrase from physics) \u0026ldquo;moduli space\u0026rdquo; is, is interesting.\nTo say a major point in short, it taught me (in hindsight somewhat) several points on how to do/not do research, what questions were good to ask, and how to break a problem into smaller problems. It was also one of the first forays I had into the difficulties of getting funding and how difficult it was to train AI models on expensive hardware.\nPart 2 #\rIn the next section, I have some more general thoughts on AI, criticisms, and CS in general.\n","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/compsci/ai-pt1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Abstract #\rAs some may know, I completed an undergraduate degree in computer science, primarily focusing on AI and reinforcement learning.","title":"AI, Research, and Why I Left Computer Science(ish) Pt. 1","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/artificial-intelligence/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Artificial-Intelligence","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/physics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Physics","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Yasin","summary":"","title":"Yasin","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"29 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/yasin/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Yasin","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/literature/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Literature","type":"tags"},{"content":"これまで私にとっては、よく難解ことであるが、色々な古典小説を読もうとしている。最近、参考までに、住野よるの「また、同じ夢を見ていた」を読んでいた。主人公が小学生ので、「このキャラの言葉や考え方は分かることがかんたんはずでしょう」と思えた。たしかに、間違ていなかったけど、「かんたん」というより、「モダン」というもっと正解です。この時、やっと気づきました。夏目漱石や太宰治の本の文体は素敵ことはすてきが、日常会話のために（とくにカジュアル会話）あまり普通じゃない。\n読書のために読むことが好きである反面、読書練習のためにも必要がある。なかでも、人間は色々ことを読むことによって勉強しないといけない。だから、古典小説を読んで勉強しようとすると、問題は起こるかもしれない。たとえば、もしかして、チャールズ・ディケンズの本からキャラのように話すことアリスに会ったら、「ちょっと変な人か本当に文学が好きな人か」と思うかもしれない。同様にもし私は侍のように「でござる」と言うことを始めたら、他の人はちょっとびっくりするかもしれない。\n実は、たくさん有名な日本人の作家は1900年ぐらい（+/-何十年か）へ書いたので、チャールズ・ディケンズの文体と比較するよりもジョン・スタインベックの文体と比較したほうがいい。とにかく、これはあまり問題じゃない。もし私はアリスに突き当たら、「立派な人みたい」と思えつもりです。\nこのポストは私にとってもっと現代小説が読むべきサインだ。村上の「ノルウェイの森」が楽しそう。たぶん、もっと新しい本を読みたい。もしおすすめがあったら、教えてください。\nもちろん、私の下手な日本語を許してほしい。\n","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/nihongo/hontachi/","section":"Posts","summary":"これまで私にとっては、よく難解ことであるが、色々な古典小説を読もうとしている。最近、参考までに、住野よるの「また、同じ夢を見ていた」を読んでいた。主人公が小学生ので、「このキャラの言葉や考え方は分かることがかんたんはずでしょう」と思えた。たしかに、間違ていなかったけど、「かんたん」というより、「モダン」というもっと正解です。この時、やっと気づきました。夏目漱石や太宰治の本の文体は素敵ことはすてきが、日常会話のために（とくにカジュアル会話）あまり普通じゃない。","title":"古典と現代小説を読むことの感想","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"日本語","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rEvery now and then, one pursues an idea thinking it could lead to something interesting, but then soon finds a dead end. Despite this, there may be one or two concepts that are interesting to talk about, yet not worthy of publication. While searching for Carroll SCFT, symmetries and unitarity bounds seem to suggest 7d SCFTs exist if they are Carroll.\nNaïve Unraveling of \\(AdS_5 \\times S^5 \\) #\rOne goal of the flat holography program is to obtain an S-matrix for flat space holographically. As Polchinski has shown, a way that one could do this is to take the limit $$R \\rightarrow \\infty$$ where \\(R\\) is the radius of AdS. There are some stringent consistency conditions that make this much harder than expected. Recently it has been shown by taking Carroll limits of Witten diagrams, one is able to obtain amplitudes that make sense. Nevertheless, these programs (celestial holography included) really only talk about the boundary theory and bulk kinematically. What one really wants is a \u0026ldquo;dictionary\u0026rdquo; analogous to AdS/CFT.\nIdeally, one would figure out a boundary theory that immediately reproduces string amplitudes ( \\(g_s\\) should be finite) in the bulk with its CFT correlators. Carroll CFTs seem to have the correct symmetry group for this. One may want to say $$\\text{Carroll SYM } \\sim \\text{IIB string theory in flat}$$ and this does seem to be the most promising take.\nFor now, a naïve (top down) approach may be to unravel the 10d AdS spacetime with compact dimensions but there immediately seems to be problems with this. In addition to difficulties in specifying the asymptotic states (see Polchinski), the AdS radius is the same as the sphere radius, the naïve limit would give $$AdS_5\\times S^5 \\rightarrow \\mathbf R^{1,9}.$$ So what seems to be the problem? If I believe in holography,. I should have a 9d theory living at null infinity, right?\nWell, some questions immediately come up. What happens to the R-charges? In the well understood description, the \\(SU(4) \\sim SO(6)\\) R-symmetry is identified with the \\(S^5\\) isometry. Something is going on here and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like the naïve approach is the one to take.\n9d (probably) does not work #\rSome might be screaming an obvious fact at this point. If you have passed 5th grade, you know SCFTs do not exist past 6d. This stems from Nahm and Minwalla and is easy to see from unitarity and symmetry arguments. In the graded Lie superconformal algebra, the even part (with SO(d+2)) needs to be represented spinorially on the odd part. This exists up to SO(8) where the vector and spinor representations are permuted under automorphisms. After this, for d\u0026gt;6, we fail.\nIn a straightforward construction, it is obvious that 9d SCFTs do not exist simply from this fact. Nonetheless, one could persevere and hope that somehow, for Carroll SCFTs, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold. Indeed, when studying the theory, we do get some interesting behavior. In the Carroll limit, the Hamiltonian becomes central and the (finite part of the) algebra becomes iso(d+1).\nIn smaller words, the effective \u0026ldquo;dimension\u0026rdquo; compared to regular CFTs drops by one. You can immediately see this by looking at unitarity bounds with descendants. Say, from the scalar primaries $$||a^{\\mu \\nu} P_\\mu P_\\nu \\ket{[0]_\\Delta}||\\geq0$$ we get $$\\frac{d-3}{2} \\geq \\Delta \\text{ instead of }\\frac{d-2}{2}.$$ With some more tedious calculations, you will find the same for vectors and spinors. You are effectively left with all the interesting dynamics going on in the other d-1 dimensions once the Hamiltonian becomes central, so all one needs to do is find a spinorial representation for so(d+1). Assuming the same reasoning holds, this all suggests that Carroll SCFTs can exist in 7 dimensions.\nDead Ends #\rSo this kind of puts a damper on finding a 9d dual to flat space in 10d. Something more complicated is going on and in taking the limit for \\(R \\rightarrow \\infty\\), one needs to be more careful.\nAt least 7d SCFTs probably works. Is there something interesting to do here? Maybe. Do I care? Not really.\nIt is well known that the super-BMS group is good for any dimension. BMS is the algebra one finds at null infinity for asymptotic flat spaces. In addition to regaining Poincare, you get an infinite algebra. It has been conjectured that superconformal Carroll in d is isomorphic to super-BMS in d+1. This has been tested up to 4d (as far as I know, maybe 5d?) but this seems to suggest this isomorphism does not hold for arbitrary dimension.\nFor now, it seems a bottom up approach would be more fruitful in establishing a dictionary. As of now, I\u0026rsquo;m working on taking the Carroll limit directly of 4d SYM. This seems to be producing some more directly interesting things\u0026hellip;\n","date":"8 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/scft/dead-ends/","section":"Posts","summary":"Every now and then, one pursues an idea thinking it could lead to something interesting, but then soon finds a dead end.","title":"Dead Ends, Flat Holography, and 7d SCFTs","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rOperators and Black Hole Info #\rToday, the arxivs have graced us with a paper on An Operator Algebraic Approach To Black Hole Information by van der Heijden and Verlinde. In it, they describe using the operator algebra picture to describe some concepts in the information paradox and particularly focus on times much later than the page time. Specifically, they look at the limits with \\(G \\rightarrow 0\\) and fixed inverse temperature \\( \\beta\\), and are able to say some very interesting things regarding how Bob can reconstruct the dictionary Alice has (rudely) thrown in.\nThey mainly focus on type I algebras and show in the limit of above, they are able to get II without the crossed product. This is extremely interesting as there may be a hope to unite the type I description (and all the unitary-ness) with the type III geometric picture. Really, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like anything would stop one from adopting Hong and Sam\u0026rsquo;s approach to push to a type III.\nThis also seems like a natural language to talk about QES and Islands as well.\nComplexity #\rComplexity, in QIS, has a well known interpretation. It is (roughly) the number of unitaries I need to apply to a reference state to get to a chosen state. Despite this, the notion of complexity in QFTs, with its infinite degrees of freedom, is hard to understand. As far as I am aware, there isn\u0026rsquo;t any concrete proposal that is widely accepted at this point.\nAt most, there are some notions of placing the theory on a lattice with some small gate set and asserting that this gives a good notion of complexity, though this is ultimately just reducing back to a Type I system. In my opinion, its not really studying (local) QFT (which should directly be III).\nIt seems like a good notion of complexity may exist in the framework of Algebraic QFT. Indeed, Hollands and Ranallo have proposed a measure of channel complexity based on Belavkin-Staszewski (BS) divergence (essentially a generalization of Araki relative entropy, BS can apply to non faithful states) $$ D_{BS}(\\phi||\\psi) = \\sup_{x} \\sup_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\left(\\phi(1) \\log n - \\int_{1/n}^\\infty \\left[ \\phi(x_t x_t^*) + \\frac{1}{t} \\psi(y_t y_t^*) \\right]\\frac{dt}{t} \\right)$$ where the complexity of the channels is $$c(T)=D(id||T).$$Notably, the only non-infinite complexities are those of conditional expectation values. Channels that act as unitaries give infinite complexity. Beyond this, the behaviors of this function seem to satisfy what one would want from complexity, additivity, monoticity, positive definiteness, etc.\nIt seems like a nice interpretation may be channel complexity is how hard it is to perform a measurement.\nComplexity for Black Holes? #\rIt is yet to be seen whether the definition of complexity above is relevant everywhere. A place where complexity pops up over and over is holography, where there seems to be some interpretation in the bulk (yet not on the QFT). This provides a decent playground for initial tests.\nA very quick check one may do is as follows:\nIn the paper above, at late time, much past the page time, an evaporating black hole of mass \\(M\\) goes to \\(M-E\\). They respectively have algebras \\(\\mathcal M\\) and \\(\\mathcal N\\) respectively with \\(\\mathcal N \\subset \\mathcal M\\). The Jones index, essentially a measure of the relative size between the two algebras, goes as $$[\\mathcal M : \\mathcal N] = \\exp 2 \\beta E.$$ Of course, this is mediated by a channel with conditional expectation value $$\\epsilon : \\mathcal M \\rightarrow \\mathcal N.$$ This quantity is related to how much information Bob can get from whatever Alice threw in at the beginning. The complexity for the BS divergence gives a very concrete answer to this, for a channel defined above $$c(\\epsilon) = \\log [\\mathcal M : \\mathcal N].$$ If we call this the complexity, we get $$c(\\epsilon) = 2 \\beta E$$ which is what one would expect to get! The complexity scales linearly at late times, as expected. Maybe this complexity is related to how difficult it is for Bob to measure outgoing radiation of interest? There is some heavy work that needs to be done for interpretation.\nThere seems to be something very tangible here that still needs to be ironed out! The above construction works in the I and II case but we are primarily interested in III. Nonetheless, the above calculations are all well defined in the type III case, so one should be able to push the construction analogous to Hong and Sam. Though in all likelyhood, it would involve hijinks with the modular operator \\(\\Delta^{is}\\).\nThis seems like a promising avenue, and it should be possible to describe the complexity of items of interest, maybe QES, islands, etc. If nothing else, the operator algebra approach seems well suited to many of these issues. Hopefully, this measure of complexity is what we want for QFT. I\u0026rsquo;ve only been looking at van der Heijden and Verlinde\u0026rsquo;s construction for a few hours, so perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll find a nice cafe and do some more serious calculations this weekend.\nTime will tell if this is the correct avenue\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/complexity/algebraic-complexity/","section":"Posts","summary":"Operators and Black Hole Info #\rToday, the arxivs have graced us with a paper on An Operator Algebraic Approach To Black Hole Information by van der Heijden and Verlinde.","title":"On Complexity in QFT and Algebras","type":"posts"},{"content":"It seems I will be here for a while, so I might as well make a list of all the coffee shops I\u0026rsquo;ve been to. This list is incomplete. There are some shops that I need to refresh my memory on before reviewing.\nCriteria and Biases #\rI have a preference for light roasts, especially naturally processed coffees. I prefer shops with a darker, more wooden aesthetic or clean minimalistic designed with a few statement pieces, location and view is important as well. I go to coffee shops for the coffee and to relax, not to work. I will not give any extra points for good productivity reasons, nor will I take away points for things like slow wifi or no outlets, though I will mention them. On the first pass, I will usually ask for a cortado, this gives a good indication of the espresso quality and their milk. Subsequently I will ask for a mocha, cappuccino, or another espresso based drink. I will very rarely ask for a pour over, generally I like to make these at home. A cappuccino is ~6 oz, if you have larger sizes, it is just a latte Scoring:\nWill score based off of coffee and the aesthetic of the shop. 1: Pretty bad taste. 2: Okay Coffee. Not the best but could be worse. 3: Average coffee shop. Decent coffee. You went in and got exactly what you expect 4: A very good coffee shop, would be happy to go here every day 5: Perfect and has a specific niche. Excellent coffee, excellent aesthetic, excellent service. Score are subject to change if I go back.\nSHOPS #\rTerrible Love(4/5) #\r+ Excellent coffee + Good texture drinks - Outside seating - No baked goods\n5 for Coffee 3 for Aesthetic Orders Absolutely excellent cortado. The notes come through clear as day. The milk has just the right texture to accompany the coffee. They also have very good tea. Besides these two items, they don\u0026rsquo;t sell any baked goods, which I miss.\nVibe It\u0026rsquo;s a coffee cart next to a building and there is no indoor seating. Yet, it still seems to have a nice vibe. There are some tables to the side. When it\u0026rsquo;s not too hot outside, it is a nice place to hang around.\nBarrett\u0026rsquo;s Coffee(3.5) #\r+ Above average coffee + Good roasters with great rotating selection\n4 for Coffee 3 for Aesthetic Orders When in Austin and needing a bag of coffee, I will usually choose Barrett\u0026rsquo;s. As a roaster they go above expectations. With the free drink I get, I almost always get a cortado, which depending on the day, could be natural processed or a blend of several different origins.\nVibe Also a dark wooden Aesthetic, lots of seating and a good mix of people working and discussing. there are loads of coffee equipment lining the walls and you can sometimes see them pulling out bags of coffee to roast in the back. A bit industrial for me, but overall very nice.\nCivil Goat(2.75/5) #\r+ Good Lemon tart + Excellent Aesthetic - Okay coffee, mainly drowned out by the milk\n2 for Coffee 3.5 for Aesthetic Orders The cortado I ordered here was not bad at all, though a bit safe for what I like. The taste and texture of the mild really dominated. Excellent lemon tart though.\nVibe I really like the Aesthetic of Civil goat. It has a nice soft modern finish with a nice view of the street. It was extremely busy when I went which I dislike and it looked as if everyone was concentrating on work,\nFlat Track Coffee(2.75/5) #\r+ Good coffee with decent selection - A bit of a commercial/industrial feel\n4 for Coffee 1.5 for Aesthetic Orders Pretty good coffee, the cortado I ordered was a very nice natural processed Ethiopian. I also got some of their coffee that they roasted which I quite enjoyed.\nVibe The location a bit more south of Austin. The vibes were not bad, they did employ a decent amount of wood but the place felt a bit too industrial for me. There\u0026rsquo;s a large Bike rack at the front and I have been told that is where several group rides start/end from.\nMedici (2.25/5) #\r+ Nice aesthetic on 2nd floor with good view of outside street + Decent selection of coffee beans - Felt extremely commercial with too much merch being sold\n2.5 for Coffee 2 for Aesthetic Orders I initially asked for an ice pour over to which the response was, \u0026ldquo;the pour over machine is broken\u0026rdquo; which I did not understand. I asked if he could do a manual pour over on a V60, Kalita, or ChemeX, but while these were available, he clearly did not want to make it, and bemoaned how long it would take. Instead I got their \u0026ldquo;flash brew\u0026rdquo;, a variation of their cold brew which used fermented, washed Ethiopians. For a \u0026ldquo;cold brew\u0026rdquo; it was as good as a cold brew could be. The pain au chocolat was nice. All in all not bad but not the greatest.\nVibe At initial glance, the vibe is nice. Plus points for wooden aesthetic with a large 1st and 2nd floor. The upstairs is a nice place to work, though clearly the furniture is a bit old and rickety. The wifi was quite slow, though I will not penalize them for this. The barista clearly knew what he was talking about and pointed out several coffee beans when I asked about them that were interesting to me. There is merch on the first floor which seems very out of place.\nLucky Lab Coffee Co. (2/5) #\r+ Inside aesthetic is nice + Has pretty good baked goods - Dark roast coffee primarily - Little inside seating and feels congested\n2 for Coffee 2 for Aesthetic Good bakery Orders I got a cappuccino and was asked the dreaded question, \u0026ldquo;what size?\u0026rdquo; I was quite disappointed to hear this and if I were not meeting friends there, would have immediately left. Instead, I asked for the 12 oz. The coffee was a dark roast with too much milk to have any discernable notes.\nI recently went back and got a pastry which was rather good. I cannot say anything besides that. Vibe The location is not bad and is very close to the UT campus. It seems the base is largely students. The inside is nice with a wooden aesthetic which I enjoy. Unfortunately the only seating inside is at the bar. It seems they also have a kitchen for food. The majority of the seating is outside shared with several other stores. It is nice, but not when it is 104 F outside. I was miserable and quickly left after my friends arrived.\nSpokesman (1.5/5) #\r2 for Coffee 1 for Aesthetic Orders The cortado here was not bad, but nothing to write home about. A bit too dark for me and the milk dominated anyways. Their Italian soda really hits the spot though.\nVibe It is right outside a climbing gym so the location is nice to go to before or after.

The 2d \u0026ldquo;boundary\u0026rdquo; is what wraps the cylinder (the thing with area \\( A=2\\pi R h\\) ) while the 3d \u0026ldquo;bulk\u0026rdquo; is the inside of the cylinder. As another example, if you take a soda can, the \u0026ldquo;bulk\u0026rdquo; is the soda and the \u0026ldquo;boundary is the aluminum.\u0026rdquo; Now if you walk around the boundary of the cylinder, hit it with a hammer, or otherwise do any action on the surface, there is an entirely equivalent process happening inside the bulk. In other words, just by studying the boundary of this cylinder, I can understand what is happening inside. This is the essence of holography. Who is this for? #\rPart of what I do in Physics is doing Holography (AKA AdS/CFT Correspondence, Gauge/Gravity Duality, etc.) As a slightly ambitious topic, I\u0026rsquo;d like to attempt making a (somewhat) Laymen\u0026rsquo;s guide. There are certainly many pop science articles and videos on the internet that explain the topic, but in a largely handwavy manner that I find not very satisfying. On the other hand, if you try to go deeper, you will quickly find that most sources expect you to have some knowledge of quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR) to make some headway. This post is dedicated to those in between, maybe having a background in science or math, but not knowing the aforementioned fields (pun non intended).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll have to delay discussions of stacking D-branes, computing correlators, or entanglement entropy to another day. For now, if you have any background in QFT/GR, I find Veronica Hubeny\u0026rsquo;s note a wonderful introduction. If you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like reading on, I\u0026rsquo;ll write the thesis here:\n$$\\text{Quantum Gravity in D dim} \\cong \\text{Gauge Theory in D-1 dim}.$$ In other words, for a quantum gravity (QG) theory living on some space D-dismensional space \\(\\mathcal M \\), a gauge theory (a QFT) on the boundary of the space, \\( \\partial \\mathcal{M} \\), can explain the dynamics of \\(\\mathcal M \\). In this case, we say the theory on \\(\\mathcal M \\) is dual to the theory on its boundary \\( \\partial \\mathcal{M} \\). This is also knows as the Holographic Principle.\nThe organization is as follows.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do I care?\u0026rdquo; details some introduction on why one would want to study holography \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo; draws some inspiration from black holes \u0026ldquo;AdS/CFT\u0026rdquo; provides a concrete model realizing holography. On first readthrough, this section can be skipped \u0026ldquo;All Thogether Now\u0026rdquo; restates the keypoints of the previous section and \u0026lsquo;derives\u0026rsquo; the duality \u0026ldquo;The Real World\u0026rdquo; ends with some comments on applications and outlooks Why do I care? #\rOur best theories of nature are quantum. The standard model, arguably the most successful model of nature ever made, describes the quantum interactions of fields (like the electromagnetic field \\(\\vec E(x) \\), where there is a value assigned to every point in space. Often we will denote fields as \\(\\phi(x)\\)). This model applies well to (relatively) small scale physics. Included in this are the 3 forces:\nElectromagnetic: Responsible for almost everything in our everyday lives Weak: Responsible for particle decays Strong: What holds quarks together Additionally, we know how QFTs work relatively well. Note QFT is a framework of which there are many concrete models.\nThe other successful theory is GR, which gives us the force of gravity. It predicts several observed phenomenon at large scales including the precession of Mercury, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves.\nTogether, these form our understanding of the universe. Yet, gravity is not included in the standard model. We believe (with good reason) that there should be a force carrying particle called the graviton that is not included. Really what I want, is a theory of quantum gravity which tells me how gravity works at very small scales. This is relevant to regimes like black holes, the big bang, and high energy regimes. This Snowmass whitepaper does a very good job of explaining why QG is important.\nUnfortunately, QG is notoriously difficult. There is a perfectly fine effective field theory, but if I want to describe any regimes of interest, I quickly realize that a naïve quantization wont work. I need new tool to describe QG. This is why I care about holography, it gives me a tool to study a theory of QG, something I don\u0026rsquo;t understand that well) by using a QFT because the physics between these two theories are essentially equivalent.\nAs a general idea, that\u0026rsquo;s all there is to it. For those that want a bit more detail, read on.\nMotivation #\rSpin Lattice #\rLet\u0026rsquo;s consider a cubic box of volume \\(V\\). Subdivide it into smaller boxes with side length \\( a \\) where \\(a^3 \u0026lt; V \\). We want to place a single (distinct) particle inside every single box of side length \\( a \\). This particle has 2 possible states it can be in, up or down. In total, we have $$ \\text{number of particles} = \\frac{V}{a^3}.$$ If we want to count all the configurations my states can take, or multiplicity \\( \\Omega, \\) we just need to add up how many possible permutations of each particle: $$\\Omega = 2^{V/a^3}.$$For example, take a box that has \\(V=2a^3\\), then the multiplicity is \\( \\Omega = 2^2 = 4 \\). To list all of them, we have: UU, UD, DU, or DD. Entropy, \\( S \\), is nothing but the log of multiplicity, which essentially counts the degrees of freedom in the system, or $$S = \\log \\Omega = \\log 2^{\\frac{V}{a^3}} = \\frac{V}{a^3} \\log 2,$$where we see that the entropy is directly proportional to volume. In fact, we could have guessed this. If we make the box of volume \\( V \\) bigger, the entropy should increase directly as well as it is directly related to the number of total particles.\nFun with Black Holes #\rHowever, let\u0026rsquo;s look at a regime of interest for us, black holes. These objects are a high energy theorists playground. They are completely described by their mass, angular momentum, and charge; yet are rich enough to lead to very complex questions. Back in the day, Bekenstein and Hawking showed us that black holes surprisingly have a temperature. Even more surprisingly, the entropy of a black hole is given by $$S_{BH} = \\frac A 4$$where \\( A \\) is the area given by the event horizon. The entropy is not proportional to the volume, but the area! Somehow, when QG enters the picture, we drastically lose a number of my degrees of freedom. This is what led Susskind, t\u0026rsquo;Hooft, and others to propose the so called holographic principle. Somehow, all we need to know about what happens in the black hole, is to study the boundary of it.\nThe study of black holes led to many a research program today. The information paradox, study of entanglement entropies and use of quantities in quantum information science (yes, the same stuff as they use for quantum computers) can all trace their roots back to this.\nAdS/CFT Correspondence #\rSo the entropy of a black hole scales with the area, so what? While there were hints of more concrete models before, it took until Maldacena\u0026rsquo;s 1997 paper where he proposed a correspondence between a theory of QG and a QFT. Arguably, gauge/gravity duality stands on its own two feet, but it has roots in string theory (in Jacques\u0026rsquo; words, the only promising candidate for QG). To state the original correspondence in full, $$\\text{String Theory on } AdS_5\\times S^5 \\cong \\mathcal N = 4 \\text{ SU(N) Super Yang Mills}.$$Don\u0026rsquo;t be overwhelmed at this point, we\u0026rsquo;ll take each point slowly and break the above statement down.\nOn the LHS, string theory is a theory of QG and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) is the spacetime that the string theory \u0026ldquo;lives on\u0026rdquo;. On the RHS, \\(\\mathcal N = 4\\) denotes the amount of supersymmetry, a symmetry between forces and matter, and an SU(N) Super Yang Mills is a CFT (A QFT with conformal invariace, which we will discuss later) analogous to the strong force. It will be helpful to include the math, but I will try to demarcate what the necessary information is so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go into it if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to. This is a concrete realization of the aforementioned holographic principle.\nOn first read through, it is sufficient to skip to \u0026ldquo;All Together Now.\u0026rdquo; The keypoints from the bottom section will be listed.\nDespite my best intentions, the best I can do is a pale mimicry of what AdS/CFT correspondence really is. Without discussing how the correspondence arises, stacking N D3-branes and looking at the perturbative expansion of large N theories and string theory, the understanding is only surface level. You need the math. For those that want this detail, I think Hong Liu\u0026rsquo;s MIT OCW on the topic is excellent and has plenty of exercises. Other than that, for now just trust me.\nGeometry #\rMeasuring Distance #\rIn everyday life, on a flat piece of paper, you will find Euclidean space. Here the shortest point between two lines is a straight line, in other words, to find the distance \\(s\\) between two points, you just need to use the Pythagorean theorem )$$s^2 = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2.$$Instead of using the differences in the two points, let me consider a super small interval, \\(x_2-x_1 = dx\\) or an infinitesimal. Then I can rewrite this as $$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2.$$This is a metric, it tells me how to measure the distance on my space. Of course, generally, our space may be curved; for instance: we might be on a sphere. If you have taken a course in multivariable calculus, in the coordinates \\((r,\\theta,\\phi)\\), the metric is given by $$ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\text{ } d\\phi^2).$$This is a space with curvature, unlike the Euclidean case.\nWhat about AdS? #\rAdS is also a space with curvature. Notably, it has a boundary. Instead of the 2 dimensional space in the Euclidean example, or the 3 dimensional space of the sphere, \\(AdS_5\\) is 5 dimensional. The \\(S^5\\), denotes the 5 sphere. It means associated to every point in \\(AdS_5\\), there are 5 extra dimensions that look like a sphere. This boundary, when you zoom in on it, looks like 4-d flat space (similar to Euclidean).\nIf you are curious, a metric for AdS (in convenient coordinates) is $$ds^2 = \\frac{R^2}{z^2}(dz^2 -dt^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2).$$ where \\(R\\) is the radius of AdS and \\(z\\) controls how close we are to the boundary. Scaling the metric conformally (see next section) and taking \\(z \\rightarrow 0\\) (to the boundary), we get $$ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2$$ which is the spacetime version of flat.\nNote that symmetries are extremely important in physics. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know what it means, but AdS has an isometry group of SO(2,4) in 5 dimensions.\nSide Note: If you try to visualize a 5d sphere, you will find it quite difficult (impossible). I once had a colleague that worked with a mathematician that studied manifolds. One day, after gaining the experience over decades, he said to my colleague, \u0026ldquo;I think I can start to envision a 3-sphere\u0026rdquo;. So maybe not impossible, you just need a few decades to try and get to a 3-sphere, maybe a few centuries to get to a 5-sphere.\nConformal Field Theory #\rI have struggled with explaining Conformal field theories to a Laymen. At some point I hope to revisit this, but for now, I will state some basic facts.\nAs some groundwork, let me describe the idea of a mapping coordinates. Wecan always choose to take my coordinates from one form to another. As an example, imagine taking Euclidean coordinated from $$x \\rightarrow x\u0026rsquo;= \\lambda x \\quad y \\rightarrow y\u0026rsquo;=\\lambda y$$ where \\(\\lambda\\) is just a number. Then the metric transforms to $$ds\u0026rsquo;^2 = dx\u0026rsquo;^2 + dy\u0026rsquo;^2 = \\lambda^2 (dx^2+dy^2)= \\lambda^2 ds^2.$$This is an example of a simple conformal transformation.\nConformal transformations are special transformations on my coordinates such that my metric changes only by some overall factor $$x \\rightarrow x\u0026rsquo; = f(x) \\quad ds^2 \\rightarrow ds\u0026rsquo;^2 = \\Omega^2(x) ds^2.$$ In response, the fields \\(\\phi(x)\\), which depend on the coordinates, also scale $$\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi\u0026rsquo;(x\u0026rsquo;)=\\lambda^{-\\Delta}\\phi(x)$$where \\(\\Delta\\) is called the scaling dimension. All you need to know is that this is a special type of QFT with some extra symmetries. Notably, CFTs have a conformal symmetry group of SO(2,4).\nString Theory #\rThere are many things I can say about string theory, but let me summarize by saying it is the only promising theory of quantum gravity thus far. Usually, in most areas of physics, we describe particles as point-like (0 dimensional); however, in string theory, the fundamental particle is a string (1-dimensional). We would expect that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t gain much from using a higher dimensional object besides being entangled (pun indented) in a more complex framework.\nIf you quantize (apply the rules of quantum mechanics to) a string, you get an infinite number of states (particles). First starting from massless states, and then going up in mass. Surprisingly, in the very first set of particles you find, the massless ones, you immediately get a graviton.\nThis means by quantizing a string, you immediately get a theory of quantum gravity.\nYou cannot ignore this graviton either. Moreover, string theory is UV complete, meaning that at high energies, the theory is still well controlled; that at high energies wedon\u0026rsquo;t get nonsense answers. This is a feature that the standard model does not possess. If you try to compute the 137th order of \\(\\alpha \\sim 1/137\\) correction to a process in Quantum Electrodynamics, all hell breaks lose.\nOf course, string theory is only consistent in 10 dimensions and has criticisms for \u0026ldquo;testability\u0026rdquo;, but this we will talk about in another post. For now, I will say the swampland program is starting to put some bounds on how QG theories must act and is making predictions for compact dimensions, dark matter, and dark energy. For instance, the force of gravity should go as \\(1/r^3\\) instead of the \\(1/r^2\\) that you learned about in kindergarten when at the micron scale. Right now our tools are good up to 30 microns so this seems possible to test soon.\nPerturbation Theory #\rThe way we calculate physical processes (particles interacting with each other) is usually with perturbation theory. When we analyze a theory, we usually start with a free theory (the particles can\u0026rsquo;t interact with other particles), and then we add the interactions controlled by some number (the coupling) \\(\\lambda\\) which tells me how strong the interaction is. Usually this looks like $$A + \\lambda B + \\lambda^2 C + \\dots$$ where A is part of my free theory, and B,C,D,\u0026hellip; are my interactions. If lambda is small \\(\\lambda \u0026laquo;1\\). I can ignore the other terms D,E,F, etc.\nSo if I want to calculate the probability of a particle interaction, it will usually look like $$ \\text{Prob } = \\lambda a + \\lambda ^2 b + O(\\lambda ^3)$$ where \\(a,b\\) are just some numbers. It turns out that string theory has interactions built in automatically; I do not have to add them by hand. The shape a string traces out is essentially a cylinder, but the interactions look like topologies with a given genus. The coupling for string theory essentially denotes which genus the interaction is taking place over, whether a sphere, torus, or higher genus shape. Summing over all genus gives me the total probability.\nThere is a much richer discussion of couplings to be had using Renormalization Group flow. In fact, AdS/CFT can also be well understood by this, but this is well out of the scope of this introduction. For now, it is sufficient to understand that at different couplings, theories behave differently.\nAll Together Now #\rLets take the keypoints from each section:\nAdS:\n\\(AdS_5 \\times S^5\\) is a 10d theory AdS has a boundary The boundary looks like 4d flat space AdS has isometry SO(2,4) CFT:\nCFTs are a special type of QFT with more symmetries CFTs in 4 dimensions have a have a conformal symmetry group of SO(2,4) The CFT of interest to us is Super Yang Mills (SYM) on 4d flat space String Theory/Perturbation Theory\nIs a theory of Quantum Gravity Couplings dictate how \u0026ldquo;likely\u0026rdquo; an interaction will happen At different couplings, theories behave differently. You can start to see how these two things may start coming together, The symmetry groups of AdS and CFT are the same. Furthermore, it turns out that the structure of the scattering amplitudes (how likely particles scatter off of others), with respect to the couplings, looks exactly the same between string theory and large N \\(SU(N)\\) gauge theories.\nMaldacena made the following insight. String theory in specific configurations, at strong couplings, looks like strings \u0026ldquo;living\u0026rdquo; on AdS. However, at weak couplings, it looks like \\(\\mathcal N = 4 \\quad SU(N) \\) SYM with large N which is geometrically on the boundary of AdS. But because the coupling on the gauge theory should be good anywhere, the conjecture is the full $$\\text{String Theory on } AdS_5\\times S^5 \\cong \\mathcal N = 4 \\text{ SU(N) Super Yang Mills}.$$ The correspondence has been extraordinarily useful and has resulted in a dictionary directly relating objects on the LHS to the RHS.\nThe Real World? #\rAs a whole, AdS/CFT and holography has been extraordinarily useful in exploring quantum gravity and has pushed our understanding of QFT. Despite this, it cannot be denied that we do not apparently live in AdS \\(\\Lambda \u0026lt; 0\\). It appears that our universe has a slight positive curvature, \\(\\Lambda \u0026gt; 0\\) (meaning there is no boundary) which means there is nowhere for our CFT to live if we naively want to consider de Sitter/CFT Correspondence. As a side note, it does seem that recent data from DESI suggests the cosmological constant may not be constant, though let\u0026rsquo;s see if this plays out.\nNonetheless, the program has been extraordinarily useful in explaining general \u0026ldquo;truths\u0026rdquo; about QG, even if they describe another universe. A robust theory of QG is better than no theory of QG. Generically, we are able to leverage AdS/CFT and holography to say things that should apply to any universe.\nBeyond this, it has seeped into condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and many other fields. For instance, you can describe the physics of superconductors with holography or calculate entanglement entropies, complexities for systems (I have thoughts on the complexities of QFT that I will leave for a more technical post) and error correcting codes.\nWhile holography is where this idea is most well understood, there are several other correspondences in other dimensions and with other geometries, including flat and de Sitter. A good chunk of people are now working on how holography may look in flat spacetimes (including me) and the prospects seem to indicate it is possible. There also seems to be some ways of rephrasing the dualities with gravitational algebras which is still a work in progress. Over the past 25 years, it has continued to make great strides and there does not seem to be any stopping for the foreseeable future.\n","date":"20 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/holography/holography/","section":"Posts","summary":"Edit 29 Sep 2024: At some point I\u0026rsquo;d like to revisit this.","title":"On Holography for Laymen","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"18 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/misc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Misc","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rRecently, I have been thinking to myself more and more that I should have a blog or a website to write down my thoughts. Inspired by several blogs, including Jacques Distler\u0026rsquo;s Blog and finally given the push by an old friend (who kindly walked me through the setup), I have decided to start this blog.\nSomething about having one\u0026rsquo;s own site appeals to me. While twitter (X?), instagram, and other sites are able to share experiences, none of them quite are quite as conducive to documenting thoughts in detail. Of course one should ask next, what do these \u0026ldquo;thoughts\u0026rdquo; entail? They should not be too spontaneous as to be worthless (worthless being defined as knowledge that no one, including me, will ever refer to), nor is this the forum to publish ideas that have spent a considerable time being polished (no need to be GRRM or Rothfuss).

While I don\u0026rsquo;t intend for this to be the common use, it is worth mentioning. At the very least, I\u0026rsquo;d like to use this to document various personal events (less so) and thoughts about the world (more so). I say this, but more frivolous uses will be here as well, maybe rating every coffee shop in Austin?\nPhysics #\rSince even more antiquated times (1989), the internet has been used for physics. Taking inspiration from Jacques, I\u0026rsquo;d like to dedicate a portion of this blog to my thoughts on concepts from physics, news, and the general life of an academic. At some point I\u0026rsquo;d like to get Latex running. If the bosonic CFT action $$S = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int d^2z \\partial X \\bar \\partial X$$is displayed I have succeeded, if not, it\u0026rsquo;s a WIP.\nLearning #\rCertainly, it is my job to learn new concepts but by this I mean more that just academic learning. Included in this category I have documenting new life skills, 日本語, and even sports (Has anyone noticed that if you throw a dart into a group of theoretical physicists, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance it will land on someone that boulders? This seems to be an international phenomenon, not just relegated to the states). Certainly more will be added.\nRandom thoughts #\rWorthless != random, nor frivolous and I think (roughly) well thought out random thoughts can go in here as well.\nProjects #\rMaybe I can include progress on my personal projects on here, though I am not yet sure. For physics, maybe some updates on what I am personally working on. My background (back in another lifetime) is in computer science so maybe at some point I can consider picking up the rubber ducky again.\nThese are what I envision as I start this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll see what happens in the future.\nTODO #\rThe site still needs some setup and there are certain things I\u0026rsquo;d like to add.
